Your work on\ngraded problem sets should written entirely on your own, although you may consult\nothers before writing. I have written a few words about what kind of solution I am\nlooking for; of course you can get more hints about that (for future use) from the\nposted solutions.\n1. (3 points) Consider the set of complex numbers\nG = {a + bi | a, b ∈ Q}.\n(The G stands for Gauss; these numbers might be called Gaussian rational numbers,\nalthough I don't know if they actually are.) Is G a field (with the same addition\nand multiplication operations as in C)? For a question like this, you should either\nexplain why all the axioms for a field are satisfied (you can assume that they hold\nfor C), or else explain why one of the axioms fails. A few sentences could be enough\nto write.\n2. (3 points) Consider the set of complex numbers\nM = {re 2πiθ | r, θ ∈ Q}.\nIs M a field?\n3. (3 points) The vector space V = (F2)2 has exactly four vectors (0, 0), (0, 1),\n(1, 0), and (1, 1); so V has exactly 24 = 16 subsets. How many of these 16 subsets\nare linearly independent? How many bases does V have? For a question like this,\nyou might write some words explaining why some kinds of subset cannot possibly\nbe linearly independent (\"the vector (1, 1) is in the pay of Big Oil, and so cannot\nbe part of any linearly independent set\"). After this you might be left with just a\nfew cases; you could perhaps say a few words about why each of these is or is not\nlinearly independent.\n4. (3 points) Axler, page 19, exercise 5.\n5.

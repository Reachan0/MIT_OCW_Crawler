  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nRecitation: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere is no course at MIT which is a prerequisite for this course. The prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. Students may also receive credit for 18.01 by transferring credit from a comparable college course taken elsewhere, or by passing an advanced standing exam.\n\nCourse Goals\n\nThe basic objective of Calculus is to relate small-scale (differential) quantities to large-scale (integrated) quantities. This is accomplished by means of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Students should demonstrate an understanding of the integral as a cumulative sum, of the derivative as a rate of change, and of the inverse relationship between integration and differentiation.\n\nStudents completing 18.01 can:\n\nUse both the definition of derivative as a limit and the rules of differentiation to differentiate functions.\n\nSketch the graph of a function using asymptotes, critical points, and the derivative test for increasing/decreasing and concavity properties.\n\nSet up max/min problems and use differentiation to solve them.\n\nSet up related rates problems and use differentiation to solve them.\n\nEvaluate integrals by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nApply integration to compute areas and volumes by slicing, volumes of revolution, arclength, and surface areas of revolution.\n\nEvaluate integrals using techniques of integration, such as substitution, inverse substitution, partial fractions and integration by parts.\n\nSet up and solve first order differential equations using separation of variables.\n\nUse L'Hopital's rule.\n\nDetermine convergence/divergence of improper integrals, and evaluate convergent improper integrals.\n\nEstimate and compare series and integrals to determine convergence.\n\nFind the Taylor series expansion of a function near a point, with emphasis on the first two or three terms.\n\nTextbook\n\nSimmons, George F.\nCalculus with Analytic Geometry\n. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, October 1, 1996. ISBN: 9780070576421.\n\nCourse Reader\n\n18.01/18.01A\nSupplementary Notes, Exercises and Solutions\n; Jerison, D., and A. Mattuck.\nCalculus 1\n.\n\nHomework\n\nThere will be 8 problem sets, due on Fridays with one exception; returned in recitation. You may turn in one problem set late with no penalty, provided you do so before solutions are given out. Partial credit may be awarded for subsequent late homework, but you must talk with your recitation instructor.\n\nExams\n\nThere will be four in-class 50 minute exams, and one 3 hour final exam.\n\nMake-up Exams\n\nIf you miss or fail an exam, you may take a make-up exam at certain arranged times. You will be notified by e-mail soon after taking an exam if you have failed it, so that you can plan for the make-up. Make-ups for failed exams can boost your grade only up to the lowest passing score (C-), which will be announced. Make-ups for full credit are permitted with a medical excuse. If you must be absent for other reasons, such as team sports, you must arrange to be excused in advance.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nWEIGHTS\n\nProblem sets\n\nExams\n\nFinal\n\nTotal",

It will be\ngraded quickly, checking that all is there and the solutions not copied.\nPart II consists of problems for which solutions are not given; it is worth more points. Some of\nthese problems are longer multi-part exercises posed here because they do not fit conveniently into\nan exam or short-answer format. See the guidelines below for what collaboration is acceptable, and\nfollow them.\nTo encourage you to keep up with the lectures, both Part I and Part II tell you for each problem\non which day you will have the needed background for it.\nPart I\n(30 points)\nNotation: 2.1 = Section 2.1 of the Simmons book;\nNotes G = section G of the Notes;\n1A-3 = Exercise 1A-3 in Section E (Exercises) of the Notes (solved in section S)\n2.4/13; 81/4 = in Simmons, respectively, section 2.4 Problem 13; page 81 Problem 4\nRecitation 0.

Read each portion of the problem before asking\nfor help. If you don't understand what is being asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and\nthen make an honest attempt to solve it.\nb) Write up each problem independently. On both Part I and II exercises you are expected to\nwrite the answer in your own words.\nc) Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If you\nfail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to serious penalties.\nd) It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters.\n0. (not until due date; 3 points)\nWrite the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you collaborated and the resources\nyou used, or say \"none\" or \"no consultation\". This includes visits outside recitation to your\nrecitation instructor. If you don't know a name, you must nevertheless identify the person, as in,\n\"tutor in Room 2-106,\" or \"the student next to me in recitation.\" Optional: note which of these\npeople or resources, if any, were particularly helpful to you.\nThis \"Problem 0\" will be assigned with every problem set. Its purpose is to make sure that you\nacknowledge (to yourself as well as others) what kind of help you require and to encourage you to\npay attention to how you learn best (with a tutor, in a group, alone). It will help us by letting us\nknow what resources you use.\n1. (Wed, 3 pts) Express (x - 1)/(x + 1) as the sum of an even and an odd function. (Simplify\nas much as possible.)\n2. (Thurs, 6 pts: 3 + 3) Sensitivity of measurement: Suppose f is a function of x. If x = x0+Δx,\nthen we define Δf = f(x) - f(x0) and Δf/Δx measures how much changes in x affect the value\nof f.\nThe planet Quirk is flat. GPS satellites hover over Quirk at an altitude of 20, 000 km (unlike\nEarth where the satellites circle twice a day). See how accurately you can estimate the distance L\nfrom the point directly below the satellite to a point on the planet surface knowing the distance h\nfrom the satellite to the point on the surface in two cases. (The letter h is for hypotenuse.)\na) Use a calculator to compute ΔL/Δh for h = h0±Δh = 25, 000±Δh, and Δh = 1, 10-1 , 10-2 .\nWrite an estimate for L in the form\n|L - L0| = |ΔL| ≤ C|Δh|\nchoosing the simplest round number C that works for all three cases.\nb) Do the same for h = 20, 001 ± Δh, Δh = 1, 10-1 , 10-2 . Is the value of L estimated more or\nless accurately than in part (a)? We will revisit this problem more systematically using calculus.\n3. (Thurs, 4pts) On the planet Quirk, a cell phone tower is a 100-foot pole on top of a green\nmound 1000 feet tall whose outline is described by the parabolic equation y = 1000 - x2 . An ant\nclimbs up the mound starting from ground level (y = 0). At what height y does the ant begin to\nsee the tower?\n\n4. (Thurs, 6 pts) 3.1/21 (parabolic mirrors)\n5.

(See full\nexplanation on PS1).\n1. (10 points: 2 + 4 + 4; and 3 extra) Golf balls\nThe area of a section of a sphere of radius R between two parallel planes that are a distance h\napart is 1\narea of a spherical section = 2πhR\nSlice the sphere of radius R by a horizontal plane. The portion of the plane inside the sphere\nis a disk of radius r ≤ R. The portion of the spherical surface above the plane is called a spherical\ncap. For example, if the plane passes through the center, then the disk has radius r = R, its\ncircumference is the equator, and the spherical cap is the Northern Hemisphere. More generally,\na spherical cap is the portion of surface of the Earth north of a latitude line. The formula above\napplies to regions between two latitude lines, and, in particular, to spherical caps.\na) Consider a spherical cap which is the portion of the surface of the sphere above horizontal\nplane that slices the sphere at or above its center. Find the area of the cap as a function of R and\nr. Do this by finding first the formula for the height h of the spherical cap in terms of r and R.\n(This height is the vertical distance from the horizontal slicing plane to the North Pole.) Then use\nyour formula for h and the formula above for the area of spherical sections.\nThis formula will be derived in Unit 4. Two examples may convince you that it is reasonable. For h = R, it gives\nthe area of the hemisphere, 2πR2 . For h = 2R it gives 4πR2, the area of the whole sphere.\n\nb) Express the formula for the area of a spherical cap in terms of R2 and r/R. (This is natural\nbecause the proportional scaling cr and cR changes the area by the factor c2.) Then use the\nlinear and quadratic approximations to (1 + x)1/2 near x = 0 to find a good and an even better\napproximation to the area of the spherical cap, appropriate when the ratio r/R is small. (Hint:\nWhat is x?) Simplify your answers as far as possible: the approximation corresponding to the\nlinear approximation to (1 + x)1/2 should be very familiar.\nc) The following problem appeared on a middle school math contest exam. The numbers have\nbeen changed to protect the innocent. Consider a golf ball that is 3 centimeters in diameter with\n100 hemispherical dimples of diameter 3 millimeters. (Note that this is not a realistic golf ball\nbecause the dimples are too deep). Find the area of the golf ball rounded to the nearest 1/100 of a\nsquare centimeter using the approximation π ≈ 3.14. (The students were given three minutes. We\nare spending more time on it.)\nUnder the rules of the contest, an incorrectly rounded answer was counted as wrong with no\npartial credit, so correct numerical approximation was crucial. Some students objected that they\ncould not figure out the area of portion of the large sphere that is removed when a dimple is\ninserted. A careless examiner had assumed that the students would use the approximation that the\narea removed for each dimple was nearly the same as the area of a flat disk. We are going to figure\nout whether this approximation is adequate or gives the wrong answer according to the rules.\nWrite down formulas for the surface area of the golf ball in the three cases listed below. (Put\nin 100 dimples, but leave r, R, and π as letters.)\ni) the approximation pretending that the removed surface is flat (what is the relationship be\ntween this and the approximations of part (b)?)\nii) the higher order approximation you derived in part (b)\niii) the exact formula\nFinally, evaluate each of the answers for the given values r = .15 and R = 1.5 centimeters, and\nfind the accuracy of the approximations.\nd) (extra credit:2 3pts) Although nobody noticed at the time, the examiner who created this\nproblem made a much bigger mistake. With the diameters actually given, it would have been\nimpossible for the number of dimples given to be placed on the golf ball without overlap. Give a\n(reasonable) estimate for the largest number of dimples that can fit on our golf ball.\n2. (4 points) Draw the graph of f(x) = 1/(1 + x2) and, directly underneath, it the graphs of\nf0(x) and f00(x). Label critical points and inflection points on the graph of f with their coordinates.\nDraw vertical lines joining these special points of the graph of f to the corresponding points on the\ngraphs below.\nExtra credit points are tabulated separately and only added to your final score at the end of the semester so that\nthey do not influence any grading cutoffs."

(Tuesday, 2pts) Hypocycloid. Show that every tangent line to the curve x 2/3 + y 2/3 = 1\nin first quadrant has the property that portion of the line in the first quadrant has length 1. (Use\nimplicit differentiation; this is the same as problem 45 page 114 of text.)\n3. (Tuesday, 7pts: 3 + 3 + 1) Sensitivity of measurement, revisited.\na) Recall that in problem 2, PS1/Part II, L2 + 20, 0002 = h2 . Use implicit differentiation\nto calculate dL/dh. Compare the linear approximation dL/dh to the error ΔL/Δh computed in\nexamples on PS1. Explain why ΔL/Δh ≤ dL/dh if the derivative is evaluated at the left endpoint\nof the interval of uncertainty (or, in other words, Δh > 0). In what range of values of h is it true\nthat ΔL\nΔh ?\n|\n| ≤ 2|\n|\nb) Suppose that the Planet Quirk is a not only flat, but one-dimensional (a straight line).\nThere are several satellites at height 20, 000 kilometers and you get readings saying that satellite 1\nis directly above the point x1 ± 10-10 and is at a distance h1 = 21, 000 ± 10-2 from you, satellite\n\n2 is directly above x2 ± 10-10 and at a distance h2 = 52, 000 ± 10-2 . Where are you and to what\naccuracy? Hint: Consider separately the cases x1 < x2 and x2 > x1.\nc) Express dL/dh in terms of the angle between the line of sight to the satellite and the horizontal\nfrom the person on the ground. (When expressed using the line-of-sight angle, the formula also\nworks for a curved planet like Earth.)\n4. (Tuesday, 5pts: 3 + 2 + 0) More sensitivity of measurement. Consider a parabolic\nmirror with equation y = -1/4 + x2 and focus at the origin. (See Problem Set 1.) A ray of light\ntraveling down vertically along the line x = a hits the mirror at the point (a, b) where b = -1/4+a2\nand goes to the origin along a ray at angle θ measured from the positive x-axis.\na) Find the formula for tan θ in terms of a and b, and calculate dθ/da using implicit differenti\nation. (Express your answer in terms of a and θ.)\nb) If the telescope records a star at θ = -π/6 and the measurement is accurate to 10-3 radians,\nuse part (a) to give an estimate as to the location of the star in the variable a.\nc) (optional; no credit) Solve for a as a function of θ alone and doublecheck your answers to\nparts (a) and (b).\n5. (Thursday, 8 pts: 3 + 3 + 2) Newton's method.\na) Compute the cube root of 9 to 6 significant figures using Newton's method. Give the general\nformula, and list numerical values, starting with x0 = 2. At what iteration k does the method\nsurpass the accuracy of your calculator or computer? (Display your answers to the accuracy of\nyour calculator or computer.)\nb) For each step xk, k = 0, 1, . . ., say whether the value is i) larger or smaller than 91/3; ii)\nlarger or smaller than the preceding value xk-1. Illustrate on the graph of x3 - 9 why this is so.\nc) Find a quadratic approximation to 91/3, and estimate the difference between the quadratic\napproximation and the exact answer. (Hint: To get a reasonable quadratic approximation, use\n9 = 8(1 + 1/8).)\n6. (extra credit 8 pts: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1) Hypocycloid, again. Here we derive the equation\nfor the hypocycloid of Problem 2 from the sweeping out property directly. This takes quite a bit\nlonger. We will look at the hypocycloid from yet another (easier) point of view later on.\nThink of the first quadrant of the xy-plane as representing the region to the right of a wall with\nthe ground as the positive x-axis and the wall as the positive y-axis. A unit length ladder is placed\nvertically against the wall. The bottom of the ladder is at x = 0 and slides to the right along the\nx-axis until the ladder is horizontal. At the same time, the top of the ladder is dragged down the\ny-axis ending at the origin (0, 0). We are going to describe the region swept out by this motion,\nin other words, the blurry region formed in a photograph of the motion if the eye of the camera is\nopen the whole time.\na) Suppose that L1 is the line segment from (0, y1) to (x1, 0) and L2 is the line segment from\n(0, y2) to (x2, 0). Find the formula for the point of intersection (x3, y3) of the two line segments.\nDon't expect the formula to be simple: It must involve all four parameters x1, x2, y1, and y2. But\nsimplify as much as possible!\nIt's important to make sure you have the right formulas before proceeding further. You can\ndoublecheck your formulas in several ways. (This is optional.)\ni) If y2 = 0, then x3 = x1.\n\nii) When the x's and y's are interchanged the formulas should be the same. What transformation\nof the plane does the exchange of x and y represent?\niii) It is impossible to find x3 and y3 if the lines are parallel, so the denominator in the formula\nmust be zero when L1 and L2 have the same slope.\niv) Rescaling all variables by a factor c leaves the formula unchanged, so the numerator of the\nformula for x3 and y3 should have degree (in all variables) one greater than the denominator.\nb) Write the equation involving x2 and y2 that expresses the property that ladder L2 has length\none. We will suppose that L1 represents the ladder at a fixed position, and L2 tends to L1. Thus\nx2 = x1 + Δx;\ny2 = y1 + Δy\nUse implicit differentiation (related rates) to find\nΔy\nlim\nΔx\n0 Δx\n→\n(Express the limit as a function of the fixed values x1 and y1.)\nc) Substitute x2 = x1 + Δx and y2 = y1 + Δy into the formula in part (a) for x3 and use part\n(b) to compute\nX = lim x3 = lim x3\nx2→x1\nΔx\n→\nSimplify as much as possible. Deduce, by symmetry alone, the formula for\nY = lim y3\nx2→x1\nd) Show that X2/3 +Y 2/3 = 1. (The limit point (X, Y ) that you found in part (c) is expressed as\na function of x1 and y1. This is the unique point of the ladder L1 that is also part of the boundary\ncurve of the region swept out by the family of ladders.)"

(Lec 19, 6 pts: 3 + 3) (+ 5 extra for part (c))\na) Suppose that at the beginning of day 0, some time last summer, the temperature in Boston\nwas y(0) = 65* Fahrenheit and that over a 50-day period, the temperature increased according to\nthe rule y0(t) = y(t)/100, with time t measured in days. Find the formula for y, and draw a graph\nof temperature on days 3 and 4, 3 ≤ t ≤ 5, and label with the correct day and shade in the regions\nwhose areas represent the average temperature each of the two days.2\n1A more colorful way of expressing 4B-6 is in terms of the volume of a tent, as in the textbook problem 7.3/7.\nUnfortunately, the problem is ill-posed and can't be done without pretending that the cross-sections are triangles.\nIn real life, the canvas would have creases. In general, the shapes formed by stretching canvas or nylon over various\narrays of tent poles are quite hard to compute.\n2The continuous average of a function is\nZ b\nf(x)dx\nb - a\na\nIn this case b - a = 1, so the average is the same as integral. For more, see Notes, AV, and Lecture 23.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nb) The number of cooling degree days is the sum for each day of the difference between the\naverage temperature for that day and 65*. The number is used to estimate the demand for electricity\nfor air conditioning. Draw a second graph of y for the whole 50 days and shade in the region whose\narea represents the total number of degree days. Write a formula for this total area as the difference\nbetween 65 50 and a definite integral. Evaluate the definite integral using the fundamental theorem\n·\nof calculus. (Alternatively, write the whole quantity as an integral expressing the area between\ncurves as in Lecture 21, and 7.2.)\nc) (extra credit) Compute the definite integral in part (b) directly by evaluating a lower Riemann\nsum and taking a limit. Follow the procedure in Problem 5, PS4, but with different scale factors.\nThis rather elaborate calculation shows how much time and effort we save every time we use the\nfundamental theorem and the change of variable formula in integrals.\nx\n2.

The square root of the average value\nof V 2 over one period of V (t) (or cycle) is called the root-mean-square voltage, abbreviated RMS.\nThis is what the voltage meter on a house records. For house current, find the RMS in terms of\nthe constant C. (The peak voltage delivered to the house is ±C.

(Lec 24, 6pts) The basis for Simpson's rule is the following formula. Let x1 be the midpoint\nof the interval [x0, x2], and denote its length by 2h. Consider any three points (x0, y0), (x1, y1),\n(x2, y2). There is a unique quadratic function (parabola)\ny = Ax2 + Bx + C\nwhose graph passes through the three points. Simpson's rule says that the area under the parabola\nabove [x0, x2] is\nh(y0 + 4y1 + y2)\nThis problem is devoted to proving this formula. It is significant because it illustrates how calcu\nlations can be simplified by using symmetry, and by looking ahead to see what you need.\nSince the area will be the same if the parabola is translated to the left or right, we may assume\nthat x0 = -h, x1 = 0, and x2 = h. Then in terms of the rest of the data (i.e., h and the yi)\nmake a sketch and determine C;\nshow, by integrating, that to find the area we need only determine A (or better, 2Ah2);\ndetermine 2Ah2 using the data;\nput the results together to establish the formula for area.\n5.

(Lec 30, 9 pts: 3 + 1 + 3 + 2) The hyperbolic sine and cosine are defined by\ncosh x = ex + e-x\n,\nsinh x = ex - e-x\n\na) Show that\nd\nd\ni)\nsinh x = cosh x and\ncosh x = sinh x.\ndx\ndx\nii) cosh2 x = 1 + sinh2 x and\n1 + cosh 2x\niii) cosh2 x =\nb) What curve is described parametrically by x = cosh t, y = sinh t? (Give the equation and\nits name.)\nc) The curve y = cosh x is known as a catenary. It is the curve formed by a chain whose two\nends are held at the same height.\ni) Sketch the curve\nii) Find its arclength from the lowest point to the point (x1, cosh x1) for a fixed x1 > 0.\nd) Find the area of the surface of revolution formed by revolving the portion of the curve from\npart (c) around the x-axis. This surface is known as a catenoid. It is interesting because it is the\nsurface of least area connecting the two circles that form its edges. If you dip two circles of wire in\na soap solution, then (with some coaxing) a soap film will form in this shape. In general, the soap\nfilms try to span a frame of wires with a surface with the least area possible.\n3. (Lec 31, 11 pts: 3 + 2 + 2 + 4) Area in polar coordinates.\na) Find the area of the right triangle with vertices at (x, y) = (0, 0), (x, y) = (a, 0) and at\n(x, y) = (a, h), using polar coordinates. (One of the less convenient ways to find the area of a\ntriangle.)\nb) Find the equation in (x, y) coordinates for the curve r = 1/(1 + sin θ) and sketch it.\nc) Find the area of the region 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/(1 + sin θ), 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, using the rectangular coordinate\nformula you found in part (b).\nd) Find the area of the region in part (c) using polar coordinates. One way to evaluate the\nintegral is to change variables to u = θ - π/2, and then use the half angle formula\n1 + cos u = 2 cos2(u/2)\nThis area was already computed in part (c), but the polar coordinate formula is still valuable\nbecause it gives the area of any sector, not just the one that is bounded by a horizontal line. The\narea swept out from the viewpoint of the focus of an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is related by\nKepler's law to the speed of planets and comets."

If you find you still have\ntrouble with some topics, go back to the problem sets which covered those, and practice on the\nrelevant Part I problems that were assigned for them. A practice final exam will be posted.\nThe table of formulas from Exam 4 will be printed with the final exam. Some problems on the\nexam related to techniques of integration may be in a new format, namely, you will be given an\nintegral formula that follows a method of integration, (integration by parts, partial fractions, or\nsubstitution) and asked to find the mistake(s) in it. The final exam will test the notion of weighted\naverage (see Problem 4, Exam 3).\nMakeup 18.01 during IAP\nStudents who receive a D in 18.01 this semester will be eligible to take a review course during\nIAP. It counts as 6 units on the IAP load, so students also in 8.01L can continue with that course.\nStudents who pass this review course will receive the usual 12 units credit for having passed 18.01.\nThe IAP review course consists of daily one or two hour review sessions, going through the\nentire course, with the hour exams occurring at the relevant times (and a make-up hour exam the\nnext day, for those who failed the earlier one). In general, there will be two or three review sessions\npreceding each exam. At the end is a final exam.\nStudents who receive an F in 18.01 this semester will in general not be eligible for the review\ncourse; they should retake 18.01 in the spring. If there are extenuating circumstances which make\nit likely that the student will be able to pass the review course, they can be considered.\nStudents who fail 18.01 will be notified by e-mail the day after the final, so they can make plans\nfor the IAP course if they wish to do so and are eligible for it."

The x-intercept is where y = 0. Plug y = 0\ninto the equation for this tangent line to get:\n0 - 1\n=\n-\n1(x - x0)\nx0\nx0\n-1\n-1\n=\nx +\nx0\nx0\nx0\nx\n=\nx0\nx0\nx\n=\nx 2\n0(\n) = 2x0\nx0\nSo, the x-intercept of this tangent line is at x = 2x0.\nNext we claim that the y-intercept is at y = 2y0. Since y =\nand x =\nare identical equations,\nx\ny\nthe graph is symmetric when x and y are exchanged. By symmetry, then, the y-intercept is at\ny = 2y0. If you don't trust reasoning with symmetry, you may follow the same chain of algebraic\nreasoning that we used in finding the x-intercept. (Remember, the y-intercept is where x = 0.)\nFinally,\nArea = (2y0)(2x0) = 2x0y0 = 2x0(\n) = 2 (see Fig. 5)\nx0\nCuriously, the area of the triangle is always 2, no matter where on the graph we draw the tangent\nline.\n\nLecture 1\n18.01 Fall 2006\ny\nx\nx0\n2x0\ny0\n2y0\nx-1\nFigure 5: Graph of x\nNotations\nCalculus, rather like English or any other language, was developed by several people. As a result,\njust as there are many ways to express the same thing, there are many notations for the derivative.\nSince y = f(x), it's natural to write\nΔy = Δf = f(x) - f(x0) = f(x0 + Δx) - f(x0)\nWe say \"Delta y\" or \"Delta f\" or the \"change in y\".\nIf we divide both sides by Δx = x - x0, we get two expressions for the difference quotient:\nΔy = Δf\nΔx\nΔx\nTaking the limit as Δx → 0, we get\nΔy\nΔx\n→\ndy\ndx (Leibniz' notation)\nΔf\nΔx\n→\nf 0(x0) (Newton's notation)\nWhen you use Leibniz' notation, you have to remember where you're evaluating the derivative\n-- in the example above, at x = x0.\nOther, equally valid notations for the derivative of a function f include\ndf , f 0, and Df\ndx\n\nLecture 1\n18.01 Fall 2006\nExample 2. f(x) = x n where n = 1, 2, 3...\nd\nWhat is\nx n?\ndx\nTo find it, plug y = f(x) into the definition of the difference quotient.\nn\nn\nΔy = (x0 + Δx)n - x0 = (x + Δx)n - x\nΔx\nΔx\nΔx\n(From here on, we replace x0 with x, so as to have less writing to do.) Since\n(x + Δx)n = (x + Δx)(x + Δx)...(x + Δx) n times\nWe can rewrite this as\n\nx n + n(Δx)x n-1 + O (Δx)2\nO(Δx)2 is shorthand for \"all of the terms with (Δx)2, (Δx)3, and so on up to (Δx)n.\" (This is part\nof what is known as the binomial theorem; see your textbook for details.)\nn\nn\nΔy = (x + Δx)n - x\n= xn + n(Δx)(xn-1) + O(Δx)2 - x\n= nx n-1 + O(Δx)\nΔx\nΔx\nΔx\nTake the limit:\nΔy\nlim\n= nx n-1\nΔx\n0 Δx\n→\nTherefore,\nd\nn\nx = nx n-1\ndx\nThis result extends to polynomials.

The x-intercept is where y = 0. Plug y = 0\ninto the equation for this tangent line to get:\n0 - 1\n=\n-\n1(x - x0)\nx0\nx0\n-1\n-1\n=\nx +\nx0\nx0\nx0\nx\n=\nx0\nx0\nx\n=\nx 2\n0(\n) = 2x0\nx0\nSo, the x-intercept of this tangent line is at x = 2x0.\nNext we claim that the y-intercept is at y = 2y0. Since y =\nand x =\nare identical equations,\nx\ny\nthe graph is symmetric when x and y are exchanged. By symmetry, then, the y-intercept is at\ny = 2y0. If you don't trust reasoning with symmetry, you may follow the same chain of algebraic\nreasoning that we used in finding the x-intercept. (Remember, the y-intercept is where x = 0.)\nFinally,\nArea = (2y0)(2x0) = 2x0y0 = 2x0(\n) = 2 (see Fig. 5)\nx0\nCuriously, the area of the triangle is always 2, no matter where on the graph we draw the tangent\nline.\n\nLecture 1\nSept. 7, 2006\n18.01 Fall 2006\ny\nx\nx0\n2x0\ny0\n2y0\nx-1\nFigure 5: Graph of x\nNotations\nCalculus, rather like English or any other language, was developed by several people. As a result,\njust as there are many ways to express the same thing, there are many notations for the derivative.\nSince y = f(x), it's natural to write\nΔy = Δf = f(x) - f(x0) = f(x0 + Δx) - f(x0)\nWe say \"Delta y\" or \"Delta f\" or the \"change in y\".\nIf we divide both sides by Δx = x - x0, we get two expressions for the difference quotient:\nΔy = Δf\nΔx\nΔx\nTaking the limit as Δx → 0, we get\nΔy\nΔx\n→\ndy\ndx (Leibniz' notation)\nΔf\nΔx\n→\nf 0(x0) (Newton's notation)\nWhen you use Leibniz' notation, you have to remember where you're evaluating the derivative\n-- in the example above, at x = x0.\nOther, equally valid notations for the derivative of a function f include\ndf , f 0, and Df\ndx\n\nLecture 1\nSept. 7, 2006\n18.01 Fall 2006\nExample 2. f(x) = x n where n = 1, 2, 3...\nd\nWhat is\nx n?\ndx\nTo find it, plug y = f(x) into the definition of the difference quotient.\nn\nn\nΔy = (x0 + Δx)n - x0 = (x + Δx)n - x\nΔx\nΔx\nΔx\n(From here on, we replace x0 with x, so as to have less writing to do.)

Define Δu, the change in u, by\nΔu = u(x + Δx) - u(x)\nWe also abbreviate u = u(x), so that u(x + Δx) = u + Δu, and, similarly, v(x + Δx) = v + Δv.\nTherefore the area of the largest rectangle is (u + Δu)(v + Δv).\nIf you let v increase and keep u constant, you add the area shaded in red. If you let u increase\nand keep v constant, you add the area shaded in yellow. The sum of areas of the red and yellow\nrectangles is:\n[u(v + Δv) - uv] + [v(u + Δu) - uv] = uΔv + vΔu\nIf Δu and Δv are small, then (Δu)(Δv) ≈ 0, that is, the area of the white rectangle is very\nsmall. Therefore the difference in area between the largest rectangle and the orange rectangle is\napproximately the same as the sum of areas of the red and yellow rectangles.

Geometrically, M(a) is the slope of the graph y = a\nat x = 0.\nThe trick to figuring out what M(a) is is to beg the question and define e as the number such\nthat M(e) = 1. Now can we be sure there is such a number e? First notice that as the base a\nx\nincreases, the graph a\ngets steeper. Next, we will estimate the slope M(a) for a = 2 and a = 4\ngeometrically. Look at the graph of 2x in Fig. 2. The secant line from (0, 1) to (1, 2) of the graph\ny = 2x has slope 1. Therefore, the slope of y = 2x at x = 0 is less: M(2) < 1 (see Fig. 2).\n1 1\nNext, look at the graph of 4x in Fig. 3. The secant line from (- 2 , 2) to (1, 0) on the graph of\ny = 4x has slope 1. Therefore, the slope of y = 4x at x = 0 is greater than M(4) > 1 (see Fig. 3).\nSomewhere in between 2 and 4 there is a base whose slope at x = 0 is 1.\n\nLecture 6\nSept. 19, 2006\n18.01 Fall 2006\ny=2x\nslope M(2)\nslope = 1 (1,2)\nsecant line\nFigure 2: Slope M(2) < 1\ny=4x\nsecant line\n(1,0)\n(-1/2, 1/2)\nslope M(4)\nFigure 3: Slope M(4) > 1\n\nLecture 6\nSept. 19, 2006\n18.01 Fall 2006\nThus we can define e to be the unique number such that\nM(e) = 1\nor, to put it another way,\nlim eh - 1 = 1\nh\nh\n→\nor, to put it still another way,\nd (e x) = 1 at x = 0\ndx\nd\nd\nWhat is\n(e x)?\nWe just defined M(e) = 1, and\n(e x) = M(e)e x . So\ndx\ndx\nd (e x) = e x\ndx\nNatural log (inverse function of ex)\nTo understand M(a) better, we study the natural log function ln(x). This function is defined as\nfollows:\nIf y = e x , then ln(y) = x\n(or)\nIf w = ln(x), then e x = w\nx\nNote that e\nis always positive, even if x is negative.\nRecall that ln(1) = 0;\nln(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1;\nln(x) > 0 for x > 1.

Then,\n\nx\na x = eln(a)\n= e x ln(a)\nThat looks like it might be tricky to differentiate. Let's work up to it:\nd e x\n=\ne x\ndx\nand by the chain rule,\nd e 3x\n=\n3e 3x\ndx\nRemember, ln(a) is just a constant number- not a variable! Therefore,\nd e(ln a)x\n=\n(ln a)e(ln a)x\ndx\nor\nd (a x) = ln(a) a x\ndx\n·\nRecall that\nd (a x) = M (a) a x\ndx\n·\nSo now we know the value of M(a):\nM(a) = ln(a).\nEven if we insist on starting with another base, like 10, the natural logarithm appears:\nd 10x = (ln 10)10x\ndx\nThe base e may seem strange at first. But, it comes up everywhere. After a while, you'll learn to\nappreciate just how natural it is.\nMethod 2: Logarithmic Differentiation.\nd\nd\nThe idea is to find\nf(x) by finding\nln(f(x)) instead. Sometimes this approach is easier. Let\ndx\ndx\nu = f(x).\n\nd\nd ln(u) du\ndu\nln(u) =\n=\ndx\ndu\ndx\nu\ndx\ndu\nSince u = f and\n= f 0, we can also write\ndx\nf 0\n(ln f)0 =\nor f 0 = f(ln f)0\nf\n\nLecture 6\nSept. 19, 2006\n18.01 Fall 2006\nx\nApply this to f(x) = a .\nd\nd\nd\nln f(x) = x ln a =\nln(f) =\nln(a x) =\n(x ln(a)) = ln(a).\n⇒ dx\ndx\ndx\n(Remember, ln(a) is a constant, not a variable.) Hence,\nd\nf 0\nd\nx\nx\n(ln f) = ln(a) =\n= ln(a)\n=\nf 0 = ln(a)f =\na = (ln a)a\ndx\n⇒ f\n⇒\n⇒ dx\nd\nExample 1.\n(x x) = ?\ndx\nWith variable (\"moving\") exponents, you should use either base e or logarithmic differentiation.\nIn this example, we will use the latter.\nf\n=\nx x\nln f\n=\nx ln x\n(ln f)0\n=\n1 (ln x) + x\n= ln(x) + 1\n·\nx\nf 0\n(ln f)0\n=\nf\nTherefore,\nf 0 = f(ln f)0 = x x (ln(x) + 1)\nIf you wanted to solve this using the base e approach, you would say f = ex ln x and differentiate\nit using the chain rule. It gets you the same answer, but requires a little more writing.\n\nk\nExample 2.

In other words, we have evaluated the limit we\nwanted:\n\nk\nlim\n1 +\n= e\nk→inf\nk\nRemark 1. We never figured out what the exact numerical value of e was. Now we can use this\nlimit formula; k = 10 gives a pretty good approximation to the actual value of e.\nRemark 2. Logs are used in all sciences and even in finance. Think about the stock market.

Since y =\nand x =\nare identical equations,\nx\ny\nthe graph is symmetric when x and y are exchanged. By symmetry, then, the y-intercept is at\ny = 2y0. If you don't trust reasoning with symmetry, you may follow the same chain of algebraic\nreasoning that we used in finding the x-intercept. (Remember, the y-intercept is where x = 0.)\nFinally,\nArea = (2y0)(2x0) = 2x0y0 = 2x0(\n) = 2 (see Fig. 5)\nx0\nCuriously, the area of the triangle is always 2, no matter where on the graph we draw the tangent\nline.\n\nLecture 1\n18.01 Fall 2006\ny\nx\nx0\n2x0\ny0\n2y0\nx-1\nFigure 5: Graph of x\nNotations\nCalculus, rather like English or any other language, was developed by several people.

Define Δu, the change in u, by\nΔu = u(x + Δx) - u(x)\nWe also abbreviate u = u(x), so that u(x + Δx) = u + Δu, and, similarly, v(x + Δx) = v + Δv.\nTherefore the area of the largest rectangle is (u + Δu)(v + Δv).\nIf you let v increase and keep u constant, you add the area shaded in red. If you let u increase\nand keep v constant, you add the area shaded in yellow. The sum of areas of the red and yellow\nrectangles is:\n[u(v + Δv) - uv] + [v(u + Δu) - uv] = uΔv + vΔu\nIf Δu and Δv are small, then (Δu)(Δv) ≈ 0, that is, the area of the white rectangle is very\nsmall.

Geometrically, M(a) is the slope of the graph y = a\nat x = 0.\nThe trick to figuring out what M(a) is is to beg the question and define e as the number such\nthat M(e) = 1. Now can we be sure there is such a number e? First notice that as the base a\nx\nincreases, the graph a\ngets steeper. Next, we will estimate the slope M(a) for a = 2 and a = 4\ngeometrically. Look at the graph of 2x in Fig. 2. The secant line from (0, 1) to (1, 2) of the graph\ny = 2x has slope 1. Therefore, the slope of y = 2x at x = 0 is less: M(2) < 1 (see Fig. 2).\n1 1\nNext, look at the graph of 4x in Fig. 3. The secant line from (- 2 , 2) to (1, 0) on the graph of\ny = 4x has slope 1. Therefore, the slope of y = 4x at x = 0 is greater than M(4) > 1 (see Fig. 3).\nSomewhere in between 2 and 4 there is a base whose slope at x = 0 is 1.\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\ny=2x\nslope M(2)\nslope = 1 (1,2)\nsecant line\nFigure 2: Slope M(2) < 1\ny=4x\nsecant line\n(1,0)\n(-1/2, 1/2)\nslope M(4)\nFigure 3: Slope M(4) > 1\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\nThus we can define e to be the unique number such that\nM(e) = 1\nor, to put it another way,\nlim eh - 1 = 1\nh\nh\n→\nor, to put it still another way,\nd (e x) = 1 at x = 0\ndx\nd\nd\nWhat is\n(e x)?\nWe just defined M(e) = 1, and\n(e x) = M(e)e x . So\ndx\ndx\nd (e x) = e x\ndx\nNatural log (inverse function of ex)\nTo understand M(a) better, we study the natural log function ln(x). This function is defined as\nfollows:\nIf y = e x , then ln(y) = x\n(or)\nIf w = ln(x), then e x = w\nx\nNote that e\nis always positive, even if x is negative.\nRecall that ln(1) = 0;\nln(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1;\nln(x) > 0 for x > 1.

Then,\n\nx\na x = eln(a)\n= e x ln(a)\nThat looks like it might be tricky to differentiate. Let's work up to it:\nd e x\n=\ne x\ndx\nand by the chain rule,\nd e 3x\n=\n3e 3x\ndx\nRemember, ln(a) is just a constant number- not a variable! Therefore,\nd e(ln a)x\n=\n(ln a)e(ln a)x\ndx\nor\nd (a x) = ln(a) a x\ndx\n·\nRecall that\nd (a x) = M (a) a x\ndx\n·\nSo now we know the value of M(a):\nM(a) = ln(a).\nEven if we insist on starting with another base, like 10, the natural logarithm appears:\nd 10x = (ln 10)10x\ndx\nThe base e may seem strange at first. But, it comes up everywhere. After a while, you'll learn to\nappreciate just how natural it is.\nMethod 2: Logarithmic Differentiation.\nd\nd\nThe idea is to find\nf(x) by finding\nln(f(x)) instead. Sometimes this approach is easier. Let\ndx\ndx\nu = f(x).\n\nd\nd ln(u) du\ndu\nln(u) =\n=\ndx\ndu\ndx\nu\ndx\ndu\nSince u = f and\n= f 0, we can also write\ndx\nf 0\n(ln f)0 =\nor f 0 = f(ln f)0\nf\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\nx\nApply this to f(x) = a .\nd\nd\nd\nln f(x) = x ln a =\nln(f) =\nln(a x) =\n(x ln(a)) = ln(a).\n⇒ dx\ndx\ndx\n(Remember, ln(a) is a constant, not a variable.) Hence,\nd\nf 0\nd\nx\nx\n(ln f) = ln(a) =\n= ln(a)\n=\nf 0 = ln(a)f =\na = (ln a)a\ndx\n⇒ f\n⇒\n⇒ dx\nd\nExample 1.\n(x x) = ?\ndx\nWith variable (\"moving\") exponents, you should use either base e or logarithmic differentiation.\nIn this example, we will use the latter.\nf\n=\nx x\nln f\n=\nx ln x\n(ln f)0\n=\n1 (ln x) + x\n= ln(x) + 1\n·\nx\nf 0\n(ln f)0\n=\nf\nTherefore,\nf 0 = f(ln f)0 = x x (ln(x) + 1)\nIf you wanted to solve this using the base e approach, you would say f = ex ln x and differentiate\nit using the chain rule. It gets you the same answer, but requires a little more writing.\n\nk\nExample 2.

In other words, we have evaluated the limit we\nwanted:\n\nk\nlim\n1 +\n= e\nk→inf\nk\nRemark 1. We never figured out what the exact numerical value of e was. Now we can use this\nlimit formula; k = 10 gives a pretty good approximation to the actual value of e.\nRemark 2. Logs are used in all sciences and even in finance. Think about the stock market. If I\nsay the market fell 50 points today, you'd need to know whether the market average before the drop\nwas 300 points or 10, 000.

If you let u increase\nand keep v constant, you add the area shaded in yellow. The sum of areas of the red and yellow\nrectangles is:\n[u(v+ Av) - uv]+ [v(u+ Au) -uv]= uAv + vAu\nIf Au and Av are small, then (Au)(Av)FZ 0, that is, the area of the white rectangle is very\nsmall.

If so, you first need to do algebraic long-\ndivision. If not, then you can split into partial fractions.\nExample.\nx2 + x + 1\n(x - 1)2(x + 2)\nWe already know the form of the solution:\nx2 + x + 1\nA\nB\nC\n=\n+\n+\n(x - 1)2(x + 2)\nx - 1\n(x - 1)2\nx + 2\nThere are two coefficients that are easy to find: B and C.

Integrate by trigonometric substitution; evaluate the trigonometric integral and work\nbackwards to the original variable by evaluating trig(trig-1) using a right triangle:\na) a2 - x2 use x = a sin u, dx = a cos u du.\nb) a2 + x2 use x = a tan u, dx = a sec2 u du\nc) x2 - a2 use x = a sec u, dx = a sec u tan u du\n2. Integrate rational functions P/Q (ratio of polynomials) by the method of partial fractions:\nIf the degree of P is less than the degree of Q, then factor Q completely into linear and quadratic\nfactors, and write P/Q as a sum of simpler terms. For example,\n3x2 + 1\nA\nB1\nB2\nCx + D\n=\n+\n+\n+\n(x - 1)(x + 2)2(x2 + 9)\nx - 1\n(x + 2)\n(x + 2)2\nx2 + 9\nTerms such as D/(x2 + 9) can be integrated using the trigonometric substitution x = 3 tan u.\nThis method can be used to evaluate the integral of any rational function. In practice, the\nhard part turns out to be factoring the denominator! In recitation you encountered two other steps\nrequired to cover every case systematically, namely, completing the square1 and long division.2\n3. Integration by parts:\nZ b\nuv0dx = uv\nb\nZ b\na\n-\nu0vdx\na\na\nThis is used when u0v is simpler than uv0. (This is often the case if u0 is simpler than u.)\n4. Arclength: ds =\ndx2 + dy2. Depending on whether you want to integrate with respect to\nx, t or y this is written\nds =\n1 + (dy/dx)2 dx;\nds =\n(dx/dt)2 + (dy/dt)2 dt;\nds =\n(dx/dy)2 + 1 dy\n5. Surface area for a surface of revolution:\na) around the x-axis: 2πyds = 2πy 1 + (dy/dx)2 dx (requires a formula for y = y(x))\nb) around the y-axis: 2πxds = 2πx (dx/dy)2 + 1 dy (requires a formula for x = x(y))\n6. Polar coordinates: x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ (or, more rarely, r =\nx2 + y2, θ = tan-1(y/x))\na) Find the polar equation for a curve from its equation in (x, y) variables by substitution.\nb) Sketch curves given in polar coordinates and understand the range of the variable θ (often\nin preparation for integration).\n7. Area in polar coordinates:\nZ θ2 1 r 2dθ\nθ1\n(Pay attention to the range of θ to be sure that you are not double-counting regions or missing\nthem.)\n1For example, we rewrite the denominator x2 + 4x + 13 = (x + 2)2 + 9 = u2 + a2 with u = x + 2 and a = 3.\n2Long division is used when the degree of P is greater than or equal to the degree of Q. It expresses P (x)/Q(x) =\nP1(x) + R(x)/Q(x) with P1 a quotient polynomial (easy to integrate) and R a remainder. The key point is that the\nremainder R has degree less than Q, so R/Q can be split into partial fractions.\n\nZ\nZ\nLecture 32: Exam 4 Review\n18.01 Fall 2006\nThe following formulas will be printed with Exam 4\nsin2 x + cos2 x = 1;\nsec2 x = tan2 x + 1\nsin2 x = 1\n2 - 1\n2 cos 2x;\ncos2 x = 1\n2 + 1\n2 cos 2x\ncos 2x = cos2 x - sin2 x;\nsin 2x = 2 sin x cos x\nd\nd\nd\nd\ndx tan x = sec x;\ndx sec x = sec x tan x;\ndx tan-1 x = 1 + x2 ;\ndx sin-1 x = √\n1 - x2\ntan x dx = - ln(cos x) + c;\nsec x dx = ln(sec x + tan x) + c\nSee the next page for a review on integration of rational functions.\n\n|\n|\nZ\nZ\n\nZ\nZ\nLecture 32: Exam 4 Review\n18.01 Fall 2006\nPostscript: Systematic integration of rational functions\nFor a general rational function P/Q, the first step is to express P/Q as the sum of a polynomial\nand a ratio in which the numerator has smaller degree than the denominator.\nFor example,\nx3\n= x + 2 +\n3x - 2\nx2 - 2x + 1\nx2 - 2x + 1\n(To carry out this long division, do not factor the denominator Q(x) = x2 - 2x + 1, just leave it\nalone.) The quotient x + 2 is a polynomial and is easy to integrate. The remainder term\n3x - 2\n(x - 1)2\nhas a numerator 3x - 2 of degree 1 which is less than the degree 2 of the denominator (x - 1)2 .\nTherefore there is a partial fraction decomposition. In fact,\n3x - 2 = (3x - 3) + 1 =\n+\n(x - 1)2\n(x - 1)2\nx - 1\n(x - 1)2\nIn general, if P has degree n and Q has degree m, then long division gives\nP (x)\nR(x)\n= P1(x) +\nQ(x)\nQ(x)\nin which P1, the quotient in the long division, has degree n - m and R, the remainder in the long\ndivision, has degree at most m - 1.\nEvaluation of the \"simple\" pieces\nThe integral\nZ\n(x -\ndx\na)n = n\n-\n-\n1(x - a)1-n + c\nif n = 1 and ln x - a + c if n = 1. On the other hand the terms\nxdx\ndx\nand\n(Ax2 + Bx + C)n\n(Ax2 + Bx + C)n\nare handled by first completing the square:\nB2\nAx2 + Bx + C = A(x - B/2A)2 + C - 4A\nUsing the variable u =\n√\nA(x - B/2A) yields combinations of integrals of the form\nudu\ndu\nand\n(u2 + k2)n\n(u2 + k2)n\nThe first integral is handled by the substitution w = u2 + k2 , dw = 2udu. The second integral can\nbe worked out using the trigonometric substitution u = k tan θ du = k sec2 θdθ. This then leads to\nsec-tan integrals, and the actual computation for large values of n are long.\nThere are also other cases that we will not cover systematically. Examples are below:\n1. If Q(x) = (x - a)m(x - b)n, then the expression is\nA1\nA2\nAm\nB1\nB2\nBn\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nx - a\n(x - a)2\n· · ·\n(x - a)m\nx - b\n(x - b)2\n· · ·\n(x - b)n\n\nLecture 32: Exam 4 Review\n18.01 Fall 2006\n2.

Therefore, the slope of y = 4x at x = 0 is greater than M(4) > 1 (see Fig. 3).\nSomewhere in between 2 and 4 there is a base whose slope at x = 0 is 1.\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\ny=2x\nslope M(2)\nslope = 1 (1,2)\nsecant line\nFigure 2: Slope M(2) < 1\ny=4x\nsecant line\n(1,0)\n(-1/2, 1/2)\nslope M(4)\nFigure 3: Slope M(4) > 1\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\nThus we can define e to be the unique number such that\nM(e) = 1\nor, to put it another way,\nlim eh - 1 = 1\nh\nh\n→\nor, to put it still another way,\nd (e x) = 1 at x = 0\ndx\nd\nd\nWhat is\n(e x)?\nWe just defined M(e) = 1, and\n(e x) = M(e)e x . So\ndx\ndx\nd (e x) = e x\ndx\nNatural log (inverse function of ex)\nTo understand M(a) better, we study the natural log function ln(x). This function is defined as\nfollows:\nIf y = e x , then ln(y) = x\n(or)\nIf w = ln(x), then e x = w\nx\nNote that e\nis always positive, even if x is negative.\nRecall that ln(1) = 0;\nln(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1;\nln(x) > 0 for x > 1. Recall also that\nln(x1x2) = ln x1 + ln x2\nLet us use implicit differentiation to find d ln(x).\nw = ln(x).

Then,\n\nx\na x = eln(a)\n= e x ln(a)\nThat looks like it might be tricky to differentiate. Let's work up to it:\nd e x\n=\ne x\ndx\nand by the chain rule,\nd e 3x\n=\n3e 3x\ndx\nRemember, ln(a) is just a constant number- not a variable! Therefore,\nd e(ln a)x\n=\n(ln a)e(ln a)x\ndx\nor\nd (a x) = ln(a) a x\ndx\n·\nRecall that\nd (a x) = M (a) a x\ndx\n·\nSo now we know the value of M(a):\nM(a) = ln(a).\nEven if we insist on starting with another base, like 10, the natural logarithm appears:\nd 10x = (ln 10)10x\ndx\nThe base e may seem strange at first. But, it comes up everywhere. After a while, you'll learn to\nappreciate just how natural it is.\nMethod 2: Logarithmic Differentiation.\nd\nd\nThe idea is to find\nf(x) by finding\nln(f(x)) instead. Sometimes this approach is easier. Let\ndx\ndx\nu = f(x).\n\nd\nd ln(u) du\ndu\nln(u) =\n=\ndx\ndu\ndx\nu\ndx\ndu\nSince u = f and\n= f 0, we can also write\ndx\nf 0\n(ln f)0 =\nor f 0 = f(ln f)0\nf\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\nx\nApply this to f(x) = a .\nd\nd\nd\nln f(x) = x ln a =\nln(f) =\nln(a x) =\n(x ln(a)) = ln(a).\n⇒ dx\ndx\ndx\n(Remember, ln(a) is a constant, not a variable.) Hence,\nd\nf 0\nd\nx\nx\n(ln f) = ln(a) =\n= ln(a)\n=\nf 0 = ln(a)f =\na = (ln a)a\ndx\n⇒ f\n⇒\n⇒ dx\nd\nExample 1.\n(x x) = ?\ndx\nWith variable (\"moving\") exponents, you should use either base e or logarithmic differentiation.\nIn this example, we will use the latter.\nf\n=\nx x\nln f\n=\nx ln x\n(ln f)0\n=\n1 (ln x) + x\n= ln(x) + 1\n·\nx\nf 0\n(ln f)0\n=\nf\nTherefore,\nf 0 = f(ln f)0 = x x (ln(x) + 1)\nIf you wanted to solve this using the base e approach, you would say f = ex ln x and differentiate\nit using the chain rule. It gets you the same answer, but requires a little more writing.\n\nk\nExample 2. Use logs to evaluate lim\n1 +\n.\nk→inf\nk\nBecause the exponent k changes, it is better to find the limit of the logarithm.\n\"\nk #\nlim ln\n1 +\nk→inf\nk\nWe know that\n\"\nk #\n\nln\n1 +\n= k ln 1 +\nk\nk\nThis expression has two competing parts, which balance: k →inf while ln 1 + k\n→ 0.\n\"\n1 k #\n\nln\n\n1 + k\nln(1 + h)\nln\n1 +\n= k ln\n1 +\n=\n=\n(with h =\n)\nk\nk\nh\nk\nk\nNext, because ln 1 = 0\n\"\nk #\nln\n1 + 1\n= ln(1 + h) - ln(1)\nk\nh\n\nLecture 6\n18.01 Fall 2006\nTake the limit: h = k → 0 as k →inf, so that\nln(1 + h) - ln(1)\nd\n\nlim\n=\nln(x)\n= 1\nh\nh\ndx\nx=1\n→\nIn all,\n\nk\nlim ln 1 +\n= 1.\nk→inf\nk\n\nk\nWe have just found that ak = ln[ 1 + k\n] → 1 as k →inf.\n\nk\nIf bk =\n1 + k\n, then bk = e ak → e 1 as k →inf. In other words, we have evaluated the limit we\nwanted:\n\nk\nlim\n1 +\n= e\nk→inf\nk\nRemark 1. We never figured out what the exact numerical value of e was. Now we can use this\nlimit formula; k = 10 gives a pretty good approximation to the actual value of e.\nRemark 2. Logs are used in all sciences and even in finance. Think about the stock market. If I\nsay the market fell 50 points today, you'd need to know whether the market average before the drop\nwas 300 points or 10, 000. In other words, you care about the percent change, or the ratio of the\nchange to the starting value:\nf 0(t)\nd\n=\nln(f(t))\nf(t)\ndt"

APPROXIMATIONS\nIn science and engineering, you often approaimate complicated functions by simpler ones\nwhich are easier to calculate with, and which show the relations between the variables more\nclearly. Of course, the approximation must be close enough to give you reasonable accuracy.\nFor this reason, approximation is a skill, one your other teachers will expect you to have.\nThis is a good place to start acquiring it.\nThroughout, we will use the symbol a to mean \"approximately equal to\"; this is a bit\nvague, but making approximations in engineering is more art than science.\n1. The linear approximation; linearizations.\nThe simplest way to approximate a function f(z) for values ofz near a jr\nis to use a linear funcion. The linear function we shall use is the one whose\ngraph is the tangent line to f(z) at x = a. This makes sense because the\ntangent line at (a, f(a)) gives a good approximation to the graph of f(z),\n_. i\nl.\nT\n.\n.\na\ns\nat\na\nto\ncose\ns\na\n(1)\nheight of the graph of f(z) s heightof the tangent at (a, f(a))\nTo turn (1) into calculus, we need the equation for the tangent line. Since the line goes\nthrough (a, f(a)) and has slope f'(a), its equation is\nS\nf(a) + f'(a)(x -\n),\nand therefore (1) can be expressed as\n(2)\nf(z)\nf() +f'(a)( - a),\nfor Tua.\nThis says that for x near a, the function f(z) can be approximated by the linear function\non the right of (2). This function - the one whose graph is the tangent line -\nis called the\nlinerization of f(z) at z = a.\nThe appraoimation (2) is often written in an equivalent form that you should become\nfamiliar with; it makes use of a dependent variable. Writing\n(3)\nv= f(z),\nA = z- a, Ay = f() -f(a),\nthe approximation (2) takes the form\n(2')\nAL\nf'(a)Az,\nfor Az\n.\nf(a)Ax\nIn this form, the quantity on the right represents the change in height of the\ntaent line, while the left measures the change in height of the eraph.\nHere are some examples of linear approximations. In all of them, we are taking a = 0,\nthis being the most important case All can be found by using (2)above and calculating\nthe derivative. You should verify each of them, and memorize the approximation.\n\nA.

As an example of verification, let\nus check (5):\nf(x) = (1+ x)'\nf'() = r(1 + x) -\n,\nfor any real r ;\nS f'(O)=r.\nTherefore, (2) becomes\nf(0) + f'(0)x\nM 1+r ,\nwhich is(5).\n(1 + z)r p f\n2. The algebraic viewpoint; examples\nThough the three basic approximations given above can be derived by using differen\ntiation, many people remember them better by relating them to high school algebra and\ngeometry. We show how.\nThe approximation (4) can be thought of as coming from the formula for the sumn of a\ngeometric series (memorize this too, if you have forgotten it):\n-= +xz+x2 +... +zX + ... ,\nIJ < 1.\n1-x\nIfx is small, then the terms z2, X3,... on the right are all negligible compared with the\nterm x, so they can be ignored, and we get (4).\nSimilarly, the approximation (5) can be thought of as coming from the binomial theorem,\nif r is a positive integer:\n(1+x)r = 1+rzx+ r(r - 1) 2+.. + r\nAs before, if xis small, we can neglect the terms in z2, s ,..., and we get the approximation\n(5). Even if r is not an integer, you will learn when you study infinite series that the binomial\ntheorem is still formally true.

APPROXIMATIONS\nContinuing this algebraic viewpoint, many other linear approximation formulas can be\nderived from the basic ones above by using algebra, rather than by going back to (2) and\ncalculating derivatives. Here are some examples of this.\nExample 1. In each of the following, we want a linear approximation valid for z - 0.\nObserve in the first two how the variable is divided by a number (or \"scaled\", as one says,\nsince it amounts to a change of scale or change of units for the variable). The purpose is to\nput the expression in a form where one of the basic approximations can be used.\nzx\n(a)\n1f\n1/2/2\nI 1-\n,\nby scaling and using (4);\n2+(\n1+\n/2\ni\nI\n= %-\n,\ns 3(1+t/18) = 3+t/6,\nfor t- 0,by using (5).\n(b)\n/9 +t\n/\n= 3(1 + t/9) / 2\nby scaling;\nExample (b) above is just as easy to do by using (2), since dg +t\nI\nIn example (c) below, however, using (2) would definitely require more work.\n2+z\n2+z\n(c)\n2+x\n2+x2\n(2+ z)(1-\nz/2),\nusing (5), then (4);\n%1/T '1+z/2\nP 2,\nmultiplying out and neglecting terms in x2 .\nNotice that in this example, the linearization 2 + 0 turns out to be a constant function.\nApproximations for za\na, where a A0 .\nThough it is most common to work near a = 0, sometimes one wants another value of a.\nEither one can use the formula (2), or else one can make a change of variable: h, Az,e are\nall common choices, related to z by\n(7)\nz = a+ h,\nz= a+ Az,\nz= a+e.\nThe new variable is then close to 0 when zis close to a. Here is an example.\nExample 2. Approximate 3 + x4 for z m 1.\nSolution. Either use (2), or change variable; doing the latter, we put = 1 + h. Then\n3+z = 3+(1 + h)4,.\ns 3+(1+4h), h;0,\nusing (5);\nS4 + 4(x - I),\nfor z s I.\nApplications. Here are a few typical uses of the linearization.\nExample 3. In the theory of special relativity, the mass m of a body moving with speed\nv is given by\nm oc\nm\n-=\nm0 = mass at rest, c= velocity of light\nWhat speed produces a 1%increase in mass?\n\nA. APPROXIMATIONS\nSolution. We could crank out the answer, using the formula for m, but in practise a\nsimplifying approximation would be used. To begin with, scale m and v, i.e., divide them\nby suitable constants to make them dimensionless: m/tmo and v/c; this turns the above\nformula into (dividing top and bottom by c):\nm\nmo\n,/ 1 - v2/c2\n- (1- u2)1/2\nwhere we have set v/c = u;.when v is small compared with c, then u s~ 0. We get, using (5)\nwith r = 1/2,\n1.\nu*\n(1- U2)/ 2\n1- (1/2)U2 m 1+ + 21\nuM0,\nwhere the second approximation used (4), with x = u2/2.\nThis approximation shows that to make m/mo = 1.01 (this represents a 1%increase in\nthe mass), we want\n==2/2\ni.e.,\na\n/.\n- 1/7.\n.01,\n=\nThe corresponding velocity is (remember that u = v/c):\nv k c/7 s (186, 000/7 mi/sec ; 27, 000 mi/sec.\nExample 4.\nGive a useful approximate formula, valid for relatively small heights,\nshowing how the weight of a body decreases as it rises above the earth, and use your\nformula to determine how high it must rise to experience a 1%loss in weight.\nSolution. Let R be the radius of the earth. The force between two masses mi and M2\nwith centers of 'mass separated by a distance d is\nGmims\nF = Gmd7\nso if the earth weight is M and our body has weight m,\nGMm\nweight at surface =\nGMm\nweight at height h above surface = (R + h)2\nso that\nweight at height h\nR 2\nweight at surface\n(R + h)2\n(1 + h/R)2 '\nwhere in this last step we made the variable dimensionless by dividing numerator and\ndenominator by R2; this scaling also makes the expression simpler. We continue with\napproximations:\n-.\n(1 - h/R)2 ,\nusing (4);\nS1 - 2h/R,\n- using (5).\nThe approximation is valid if h/R e 0, i.e., if h is very small compared to R.\n\nA. APPROXIMATIONS\nUsing our approximation, we see that to make the ratio of the weights ; .99, we want\n2h\n.01R\n.01 .4, 000\nR S.01,\ni.e.,\nh = 2 =\n= 20 miles.\n4. Quadratic approximations.\nTo get greater accuracy, sometimes one wants to include higher-order terms in the ap\nproximating function. If we include second-order terms -\nthat is, terms in (x - a)2, we get\nwhat is called a quadratic approximation for x w a. It looks like\n(8)\nf ()\ns A + B(x - a) + C(x - a)2,\nz~ a.\nThere is a general formula for the coefficients A, B, C using calcihlus, but let's work alge\nbraically first, and consider the basic approximations.\nBasic Quadratic Approximations\n1-z\n(10)\n(1+x)r\n1 +rz+ r(r- 1);2 ,\nforxs0; risanyrealnumber\n(11).\nsinx M =,\nfor x\nO.\n(12)\ncos\n;U 1 - -\n,\nforzzX 0.\nDiscussion\nFormula (9) comes as before from the sum of the geometric series.\nFormula (10) is the beginning of the binomial theorem, if r is an integer.\nFormula (11) looks like our earlier linear approximation, but the assertion here is that it\nis also the best quadratic approximation -\nthat is, the term in x2 has 0 for its coefficient.\nThis is so because sin x is an odd function, so the approximating polynomial should be odd\nalso, which means it cannot have any x2 term.\nFormula (12) is derived from (11) and the identity sin x+\nz\ncos 2 x = 1; this is one of the\nexercises.\nUsing these basic quadratic approximations, we can by algebra get quadratic approxima\ntions to more involved expressions. Examples are given below. In studying the examples,\nSnotice that during the course of the calculation, all approximationsmust be quadratic. If\none of the approximations you use is only linear, then that contaminates the final result,\nwhich probably will not have the correct x2 term. This is the same principle you meet in\nadding numbers: if one of the numbers is only good to one decimal place, then no matter\nhow accurate all the other numbers are, the sum will only be good to one decimal place.\n\nA. APPROXIMATIONS\nExample 5.\nBy using the basic approximations, give quadratic approximations valid\nfor x.\n0 for each of the following:\ncosx\n(a) secx\n(b)\nV +3x\n(c)\n/1+x+x 2\n(d)\n1-x\nSolution.\n(a)\nsec x =\nz--\n1 + 2, by (12) and (4).\ncosax\n1 - 22/2'\n(b)\nV1\n= (1 + 3x)1/ 2 ;\n1 + I(3x) -\n(3x)2,\nby (10);\nSi+.2 x-x2 .\nS1+\n(X + X2)\n(\n)2 ;$ 1 +\n+ X,\n(X+\nby(10).\n(d)\n-x\n(1XX\n)\n+ +-.\nTo illustrate what happens if you don't keep enough terms during the calculation, observe\nthat if in (d).above we only used 1+ x in the right-hand factor, the answer would have been\n1+ x - x2/2, whose x2 term is incorrect.\n6. The quadratic approximation formula.\n(13)\nf(x) z f(a)- f'(a)(x - a)+ f\n- a)2,\nfor x a.\nExample 6. Check formulas (10) and (11) by using (13).\nSolution. Since the first two terms of (13) are the linearization, we can build on our earlier\nwork, and have only to calculate the quadratic coefficient f\"(0)/2. We get\n(a)\nsinx ;\n0 + x +02 2 ,\nsince sin\"(x) = -sin x\n=\nsin\"(0) = 0.\n(b)\nf\"(0)\nr(r-\n)\nr - '\n2 .\nas in(10).\nf (x)= (1+x)r\nf(x)=r(r -1)(1-\nx)\nThe usefulness of (13) is tempered by the fact that it requires calculation of second\nderivatives. This can get rather tedious -\nfunction (d) in Example 5 is a good illustration\n-\nso that using the algebraic techniques is often better.\n\nA. APPROXIMATIONS\nThe quadratic approximation formula (13) may be \"derived\" as follow. We are looking\nfor the right choice of coefficients in\n(14)\nf(s)\nA + B(z - a) + C(z - a)2,\nz a.\nLet us denote by Q(x) the polynomial on the right of (14). Then itmakes sense to choose\nthe coefficients A, B, C so that f(s) and Q(z) have the same 'alue and the. same first and\nsecond derivatives at a, i.e., so that\n(15)\nf(a) = Q(a),\nf'(a) = Q'(a),\nf\"(a) = Q\"(a).\nSince Q'(s) = B + 2C(r - a)and Q\"(z)= 2C, equations (15) say that\n(16)\nf(a) =A,\nf'(a) =B,\nf\"(a) = 2C;\nthese values for A, B, C turn (14) into (13), as promised. Note that the first two terms on\nthe right of (13) give the linearization at z = a; thus the quadratic approximation refines\nthe linear approximation by adding a quadratic term to it.\nExercises: Section 2A"

AVERAGE VALUE\nWhat was the average temperature on July 4 in Boston?\nT\nT\nThe temperature is a continuous function f(z), whose graph over the\n24-hour period inight look as shown. How should we define the average\nvalue of such a function over the time interval [0, 24] -- measuring time\ns in hours, with z = 0 at 12:00AM ?\n18 24 x\nWe could observe the temperature in the middle of every hour, that is, at the times\nzX = .5,zs = 1.5,... ,z4 = 23.5, then average these 24 observations, getting\n=1\nTo get a more accurate answer, we could average measurements made more frequently, say\nevery ten minutes.\nFor a general interval [a, b] and function f(z), the analogous procedure would be to divide\nup the interval into n equal parts, each of length\nb-a\n(1)\nA. = -n\nand average the values of the function f(x) at a succession of points zi, where sx lies in the\ni-th interval. Then we ought to have\n(2)\naverage of f(z) over [a,b]b\nn\nz .\"(a\nWe can relate the sum on the right to a definite integral: using (1), (2) becomes\n(3)\naverage of f () over [a,b]\nf ()A\n.\nAsn-a\nAs n *- co, the sum on the right-hand side of (3) approaches the definite integral of f(z)\nover [a, b], and we thereforedefine the average value of the function f(z) on [a, b] by\n(4)\nA = averageof f() over [, ] =\n(x)dx.\nGeometrically, the average value A can be thought of as the height of that\nconstant function Awhich has the same area over [a, b] as f(z) does. This\nis so since (4a)shows that\nA.(-) =\nf()\n.\n.\n.\n-.-.\n\nAV. AVERAGE VALUE\nExample 1. In alternating current, voltage is represented by a sine\nwave with a frequency of 60 cycles/second, and a peak of 120 volts. What\nis the average voltage?\n21r\n27r\nSolution. The voltage function has frequency\n-\n= 120r,\n11/i2o\nperiod\n1/60\nand amplitude 120, so it is given by V(t) = 120 sin(120irt). Thus by (4).\n1/120\naverage V(t) = 120\nV(t) dt\n-\ncos(120rt\n= -.\n120.\nJO\no0\n(We integrate over [0,1/120] rather than [0,1/60] since we don't want zero\nas the average.)\nExample 2.\na) A point is chosen at random on the z-axis between -1 and 1; call\nit P.. What is the average length of the vertical chord to the unit circle\nDassing through P?\nb) Same question, but now the point P is chosen at random on the circumference.\nSolution. a) If P is at x, the chord has length 2 vTC, so we get\naverage of 2\nX over [-1, 1] =\n2V -x 2d = area of semicircle = 7r\n1.6.\no2e\n\nb) By symmetryi we can suppose P is on the upper semicircle.

CONTINUITY AND\nDISCONTINUITY\n1. One-sided limits\nWe begin by expanding the notion of limit to include what are called one-sided limits,\nwhere z approaches a only from one side -\nthe right or the left. The terminology and\nnotation is:.\nright-hand limit\nlim f(x)\n(z comes from the right, x > a)\nleft-hand limit\nlim f(z)\n(x comes from the left, z < a)\nX\nML_\nSince we use limits informally, a few examples will be enough to indicate the usefulness of\nthis idea.\n1/x 2\n.1\nEx. 1\nEx.2\nEx. 3\nEx.4\nExample 1.\nlim V/l-\n2 = 0\n=--1-\n=-*-1+\n(As the picture shows, at the two endpoints of the domain, we only have a one-sided limit.)\nz\nExample 2. Set f(z)=\n1 X 0.\nThen\n>\n,*---+\nlim f() = -1,\nX-00+\nlim f() =1.\nExample 3.\nli\n-\n= oo,\nlim -\n= -oo\n-_O0+ X\n2--0- 2\nExample 4.\nli n-\n=oo,\nlim\n-\noo\n.--40+\n2-o- z\nThe relationship between the one-sided limits and the usual (two-sided) limit.is given by\n(1)\n.\nIC-=+&\nlim f(x) = L\nlim f(x) = L and\nlim f() = L\n2-40+\nIn words, the (two-sided) limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal.\nThis shows for example that in Examples 2 and 3 above, lim f(z) does not exist.\nStudents often say carelessly that lim 1/x = oo, but this is not sloppy, it is simply\n2--+0\nwrong, as the picture for Example 3 shows. By contrast, lirn 1/z\n= oo is correct and\nacceptable terminology.\n\n2. Continuity\nTob understand continuity, it helps to see how a function can fail to be continuous. All\nof the important functions used in calculus and analysis are continuous except at isolated\npoints. Such points are called points of discontinuity. There are several types. Let's begin\nby first recalling the definition of continuity (cf. book, p. 75).\n(2)\nff()\nis continuous at a\ni\nlim f(x) = f(a).\nThus, if a is a point of discontinuity, 'something about the limit statement in (2) must fail\nto be true.\nTypes of Discontinuity\nX2 1\nsin (l I)\nsn(I/z)\nremovable\nremovable\njump\ninfinite\nessential\nIn a removable discontinuity, lim f(x) exists, but lim f(z) ff(a). This may be because\n--ia\ns--+a\nf(a) is undefined, or because f(a)has the \"wrong\" value. The discontinuity can be removed\nby changing the definition of f(x) at a so that its new value there is lir f(z). In the left-most\npicture,\n-\nis undefined when x = 1, but if the definition of the function is completed\nz-1\nby setting f(1) = 2, it becomes continuous -\nthe hole in its graph is \"filled in\".\nIn a jump discontinuity (Example 2), the right- and left-hand limits both exist, but\nare not equal. Thus, lim f(z) does not exist, according to (1). The size of the jump is\nthe difference between the right- and left-hand limits (it is 2 in Example 2, for instance).\nThough jump discontinuities are not common in functions given by simple formulas, they\noccur frequently in engineering -\nfor example, the square waves in electrical engineering,\nor the sudden discharge of a capacitor.\nIn an infinite discontinuity (Examples 3 and 4), the one-sided limits exist (perhaps as oo\nor -oo), and at least one of them is foo.\nAn essential discontinuity is one which isn't of the three previous types -\nat least one of\nthe one-sided limits doesn't exist (not even as ±oo). Though sin(1/z) is a standard simple\nexample of a function with an essential discontinuity at 0,in applications they arise rarely,\npresumably because Mother Nature has no use for them.\nWe say a function is continuous on an interval [a, b]if it is defined on that interval and\ncontinuous at every point of that interval. (At the endpoints, we only use the approrpiate\none-sided limit in applying the definition (2).)\n\nC.\nCONTINUITY AND DISCONTINUITY\nWe say a function is continuousif its domain is an interval,and it is continuous at every\npoint of that interval.\nA point of discontinuityis always understood to be isolated, i.e., it is the only bad point\nfor the function on some interval.\nWe illustrate the point of these definitions. (They are slightly different from the ones in\nyour book, but are more consistent with standard terminology in calculus.)\nI\nI\nI\nI\naI\nI\nt\n! II'\nIl 1I/II I 1:\nIrs\nX /I*I\nS\nI\ni/ ! I a/ a\nIi\nI\nI I\nI\nI\nI I\nII\nI\nExample 5\nExample 6\nExample 7\nExample 8\nExample 5. The function 1/z is continuous on (0, oo) and on (-oo, 0), i.e., for z > 0\nand for z < 0, in other words, at every point in its domain. However, it is not a continuous\nfunction since its domain is not an interval. It has a single point of discontinuity, namely\nz = 0, and it has an infinite discontinuity there.\nExample 6. The function tanz is not continuous, but is continuous on for example the\ninterval -ir/2 < x < ir/2. It has infinitely many points of-discontinuity, at +ir/2, 13r/2,\netc.; all are infinite discontinuities.\nExample 7; f () = Jz- is continuous, but f'(z) has a jump discontinuity at 0.\nExample 8.\nThe function in Example 2, f(z) =\n-1,\n1, X><0,0 does not have a\ncontinuous derivative f'(z) -\nstudents often think it does since it seems that f'(z) = 0\neverywhere. However this is not so: f'(0) does not exist, since by definition,\n'f(O\n+ Az) - f(0)\nAX--+O\nAX\nbut f(0) does not even exist. Even if f(0) is defined to be say 1, or 0, the derivative f'(0)\ndoes not exist.\nRemember the important little theorem (Simmons p. 75)\n(3)\nf(z) differentiable at a\nf(z) continuous at a\nor to put it contrapositively,\n\"f(x) discontinuous at a\n=-\nf(z) not differentiable at a\nThe function in Example 8 is discontinuous at 0, so it has no derivative at 0; the discontinuity\nof f'(x) at 0 is a removable discontinuity.\nExercises: Section 1D"

EXPONENTIALS\nAND LOGARITHMS\n1. The Exponential and Logarithm Functions.\nWe have so far worked with the algebraic functions -\nthose involving polynomials and\nroot extractions - and with the trigonometric functions. We now have to add to our list the\nexponential and logarithm functions, since these are used in your science and engineering\ncourses from the beginning. Your book will handle the calculus of these functions; here we\nwant to review briefly their algebraic properties, and look at applications; one or two of\nthem might be new to you.\nWhere does one encounter exponentials and logarithms? In general, exponentials are\nused to express all sorts of simple growth and decay processes.\n1. The growth of a bacteria colony which doubles in size every day:\ny = yo2 t ,\nwhere t = time in days, y = population size, yo = the initial size, i.e., size at t = 0.\n2. Dollars in a bank account, at 5%.interest compounded annually:\nA = Ao(l.05)n ,\nwhere n = number of years, A = amount, Ao = initial amount (the \"principal\").\n3. Amount of radioactive substance, with a 1 year half-life:\nx = zo(1/2)n = zo2 n,\nwhere n = number of years,\nx = amount,\n0o= initial amount.\nThere are many other examples: the decay of electric charge on a capacitor, the way\na hot and cold body come to the same temperature when they are brought together, the\nfalling of a body through a resisting medium (a steel ball dropped into oil, for instance)\nall involve exponentials when you express them in mathematical terms.\nWe use logarithms when the base of the exponential is unimportant and we want to focus\nour attention on the exponents instead. Suppose the base is 10; writing simply \"log\" for\n\"log 0o\"in what follows, we have\ny = 10'\n€\nlogy = z.\n1. Star magnitude. The observed brightness B of a star is described by comparing it\nto a standard brightness Bo, using the equation\nB = BolO-\n5 .\nThe important thing is the number m called the magnitude; it is defined by the above\nequation, or equivalently, taking logs, by\nB\nm = -\nlog\n.\n2 Bo\nThus, the higher the magnitude, the fainter, the star. A star of brightness Bo, if one existed,\nwould have magnitude zero. Thus the constant Bo gives the magnitude scale a zero point.\nThis point was chosen so that the brightest stars (other than the sun) -\nSirius and Vega,\nfor example -\nwould have magnitude near 1, i.e., be stars of the first magnitude.\n\n2. Orders of magnitude. We speak of a kilometer as \"three orders of magnitude\"\ngreater than a meter. That is\nkm\n= 103,\n3 = log (.\nmeter\nmeter\nIn general, when we compare two quantities A and B;\nnumber of orders of magnitude by which A is greater than B = log(A/B) .\n3. Chemical pH. In chemistry, the acidity or alkalinity of a solution is measured by\nthe concentration [H+] of hydrogen ions in the solution, in units of moles/liter.\nIf for some solution the concentration [H+] = 10\", then we define\npH of solution = -n = - log [H+].\nThe negative sign is used to avoid always having negative pH's, since the concentration [H+]\nis very small.\nThe algebraic laws.\nWe will begin with a brief review of the algebra of exponentials.and logarithms. Please\nstudy the examples given of calculations, since many students seem to have trouble with\nthis.\nWe fix a number a > 0, called the base. The pair of equations\n(1)\ny = a=\nlog, y= z\nare equivalent; both express the same relation between z and y. If you substitute one\nequation into the other, you get two other equations which are often more useful in practice\nthan those in (1) (the examples will illustrate):\n(2)\ny= logYY\n.-log.(ac ) = x.\nIn the first, we take the log then exponentiate; in the second, we exponentiate, then take\nthe log; in both.cases, we end up where we started.\nThe two basic algebraic laws governing exponentials and logarithms are\n(3)\naL2+\n= ='2a 2'\nlog0. y + log. y2 = log01912.\n(4)\n(a=)k = ak..\nlog'y~ = k log. yl\nThe laws on either side follow from those on the other side by substituting y1 = a\"- or\nxj = log. y1, and then using (1) or (2).\n\nX. EXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS\nGraphs of the exponential and log functions\nThe picture on the left below shows 'some graphs of the exponential function a\" for\ndifferent choices of bases. (We will discuss the base e ; 2.718 presently.)\nThe,graph rises if a > 1, falls if a < 1. Since\n= a-, the graph of (1/a)\" is\nobtained by reflecting the graph of a\" in the y-axis. (See Notes G, p. G.2.)\nThe pair of equivalent equations y = a' and x = log. y show that af and log, z are\ninversefunctions,according to Notes G, pp. G.8,9. Thus the graph of log, z is obtained by\nreflecting the graph of ae in the diagonal line y = z. The reasoning for this needs a lot of\nrepetition to sink in, so we repeat it briefly once more. Namely, consider in turn the three\nequations\ny = ax\nz = ay\ny = loga X\nSince the second equation arises from the first by switching z and y, the graph of the second\nequation is obtained by flipping the first graph around the diagonal line y = z; the third\nequation has the same graph as the second, since it's the same equation - we've only solved\nit for y. To sum up: the first and third equations have graphs which are reflections of each\nother about y = x.\nThe base e. Changing the base.\nThere are really only two or three bases in common use.\nFor areas in science and engineering where calculus does not enter, or where at least\nhistorically it was not used, the base 10 is the usual choice, because it associates naturally\nwith the decimal system, making rough estimations of the size of exponentials a fairly easy\nthing to do.\nOh the other hand, if you are going to have to differentiate or integrate, the base e.e 2.718\nis the usual choice. (The symbol e was introduced by Euler -\nthe first letter of both\n\"exponential\" and \"Euler\".) As you will see, it is the base which makes for the simplest-\nlooking differentiation and integration formulas for exponentials and logs.\n(To the above two, one should perhaps add the base 2,which is useful in computer science,\nwith its bits and bytes.)\nFor base e and base 10, the corresponding notations for the logarithm are\nlog, x = In x (the \"natural logarithm\");\nloglo X = log .\n(Warning: Many pure mathematics books use log z for the natural logarithm; science and\nengineering books generally use inz. Some computer science books use log z to mean log12 .)\n\nUsing science and engineering notation, the logarithm laws read, for the bases e and 10:\nln(ab) = Ina + nb\nlog(ab)' = log a + log b\nln(ab) = bIn a\nlog(ab) = bloga\nand\n(6)\nIn(e))= , eIn =\nlog(10) = z, 10 10og= X\nIne = 1, Inl=\n0; el =e, e\n= l\nlog 10 = 1, logl = 0; 10' = 10, 100= 1.\nOther bases. The reason why it is not necessary to use other bases is that all other\nexponentials and logarithms can be written in terms of e\" and Ins, or if one prefers, in\nterms of 10S and logz. Since in calculus we use the base e, let's use this base. Using (6),\nwe have for any base a > 0,\na\"= (e=n ). e.na.\nThus the functions ek' , for different-constants k, represent all of the exponential functions\na. no matter what the base a is.\nAs for logarithms, starting with the equations\na\" = y,\nz = log,\n,\ntaking the natural log of the equation on the left gives\n(In a) = Iny .\nSolving for x and substituting into the second equation, we get\nIny\nlog., =hav\nIna\nFinally, changing the variable from yto z,we have\nIns\nlog a =\n;7a\nin particular,\nlog\n= lin10\nStudy these transformations until you can reproduce them easily.\nIn calculations, students usually find it easy to use the laws of exponentials and logs.\nThe chief trouble is in passing from the log to the exponential and vice-versa. Study the\nfollowing examples, and don't go further until you have tried some of the exercises. Notice\nthat you can almost always get through using (2); whereas the equations (1) sometimes\naren't good enough, and even when they are, they require too much thinking. The general\nprinciple which governs the following calculations is:\n'(8)\nTo get rid of logs, exponentiate; to get rid of exponentials, take the logs.\n\nX. EXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS\nExample 1. If one liquid has a pH which is 4 greater than the pH of a second liquid,\nwhat is the relation between the [H+] concentrations of the two liquids? (cf. p.X.1)\nFirst Solution. Using subscripts to distinguish the two liquids,\n(pH)i = .(pH)2 + 4\n-log[H+]i\n= -log[H +] +4\nMultipljing through by -1, then exponentiating both sides (base 10) and using (6),\n[H+] = [H+]2.-10- 4.\nSecond Solution.\nStarting from the second line, put both logs on the left side, and\ncombine them using (5) (remember that - log a = In(1/a)), then exponentiate both sides\n(or use (1)).\nExample 2 A radioactive substance decays according to the law y = yoekt . Two\nmeasurements are made: at time ti, there is an amount y7present, where i = 1,2. Express\nk in terms of the yj- and ti.\nSolution. We have y2 = yoe6kt and yl = yoekt.

GRAPHING FUNCTIONS\nTo get a quick insight into how the graph of a function looks, it is very helpful to know\nhow certain simple operations on the graph are related to the way the function expression\nlooks. We consider these here.\n1. Right-left translation.\nLet c > 0. Start with the graph of some function f(x). Keep the x-axis and y-amis fixed,\nbut move the graph c units to the right, or c units to the left. (See the pictures below.) You\nget the graphs of two new functions:\n(1) Moving the f(x) graphc units to the\nright\ngives the graph of\n(x - c)\nS left\nf(X + c)\nIf f(x) is given by a formula in x, then f(x - c) is the function obtained by replacing x by\nx - c wherever it occurs in the formula. For instance,\nf()\n=(--)=\n(x-\n) 2+(X-)\n2--z, byalgebra.\nExample 1. Sketch the graph of f(s) = x2 - 2x + 1.\nSolution. By algebra, f(x) = (X - 1)2. Therefore by (1), its graph is\nthe one obtained by moving the graph of x2 one unit to the right, as shown.\nThe result is a parabola touching the x-axis at x = 1.\nTo see the reason for the rule (1), suppose the graph of f(z) is moved c units to the right:\nit becomes then the graph of a new function g(x), whose relation to f(s) is described by\n(see the picture):\nvalue of g() at zo\n=\nvalue off(z) at o - c\nf(zo-c).\nThis shows that g(z) = f(x - c).\nx\nj\nxY\nThe reasoning is similar if the\n(\ngraph is translated c units to the left. Try giving the argument\nyourself while referring to the picture.\nV-C\nThe effect of up-down translation of the graph is much simpler to see. If c > 0,\n(2) Moving the f(x)graph cunits\nf(T) +\ngives the graph of\n-c\ndown\nf (x)-- c\nsince for example moving the graph up by c units has the effect of adding c units to each\nfunction value, and therefore gives us the graph of the function f(s) + c\nExample 2. Sketch the graph of 1 +\nT/2-.\nSolution Combine rules (1) and (2). First sketch V- , then\nmove its graph 1 unit to the right to get the graph of Vf-Z,\nthen\n1 unit up to get the graph of 1 +-,- 1. as shown.\n1nio th o\nf1+-,fm -I\nx\n\nExample 3. Sketch the curve y = z2 + 4x +1.\nSolution We \"complete the square\":\n2+4z+\n= (z2 +4z+4)-3 = (z+2)2-3,\nso we move the graph of z2 to the left 2 units, then 3 units down,\nnettine\nthe granh shown.\n2. Changing scale: _stretching and shrinking.\nLet c > 1. To stretch the z-axis by the factor c means to move the point 1to the position\nformerly occupied by c,and in general, the point so to the position formerly occupied by c0o.\nSimilarly, to shrink the z-axis by the factor c means to move so to the position previously\ntaken by zo/c. What happens to the graph of f(z) when we stretch or shrink the z-axis?\nStretching\n{f(z/c)\n(3)\ntretci-ng\nthe -aisby c changes the graph of f(z) into that of\nf(c)\nShranking\nf(cm)\nThe picture explains this rule; it illustrates stretching by the factor\nfr\nXC)\nc > 1. The new function has the same value at so that f(z) has\nat zo/c, so that it is given by the rule zo -+ f(zo/c), which means\ni\nthat it is the function f(z/c).\n/e\n-o\nIf the y-axis is stretched by the factor c > 1, each y-value is multiplied by c, so the new\ngraph is that of the function cf(z):\n(4)\nrething the y-ais by c changes the graph of f(z) into that of\ncf(s)\nShrinking\nf(z)/c\nExample 4. Sketch the graph of\n.\nSolution. Start with the graph of 1/z,move it 1lunit to the\nright to get the graph of 1/(z - 1), then shrink the x-axis by the\nfactor 2 to get the graph of the given function. See the picture.\n3. Reflecting in the z- and V-axes: even and odd functions.\nTo reflect the graph of f(z) in the y-axis, just flip the plane over around\nthe y-axis. This carries the point (z, y) into the point (-z,y), and the graph\n.4A(x)\nof f(z) into the graph of f(-z). Namely, the new function has the same\ny-value at zo as f(s) has at -zo, so it is given by the rule so -+ f(-zo)\nand is the function f(-z).\n) an the\nSimilarly, reflecting the si-plane in the x-axis carries (z, y) to the point (Z,-y) and the\ngraph of f(z) gets carried into that of -f(s).\nFinally, relecting first in the y-axis and then in the x-axis carries the\npoint (z,y) into the point (-z,-y).\nThis is called a reflection through\nthe origin. The graph of f(z) gets carried into the graph of -f(-z), by\ncombining the above two results. Summarizing:\ny-azis\nf(-z)\n(5) Reflecting in the\nz-azis\nmove the graph of 1(z) into that of\n-f(z)\norigin\n-(-)\n\nG. GRAPHING FUNCTIONS\n{ y-axis\nf -X)\n(5) Reflecting inthe\ns-axis moves the graph off(s) into that of\n-f(s)\norigin .\n-f(-X).\nOf importance are those functions f(t) whose graphs, are symmetric with respect to the\ny-axis -\nthat is, reflection in the y-axis doesn't change the graph; such functions are called\neven. Funrctions whose graphs are symmetric with respect to the origin are called odd. In\nterms of their expression in s,\n(6)\nf(-X) =f(s)\ndefinition of even function\n(7)\nf(-X) = -f (s)\ndefinition of odd function\nExample 5. Show thit a polynomial with only even powers, like z4 - 2s2 + 7, is an\neven function, and a polynomial with only odd powers, like 35s - s + 2z, is an odd function\n-\nthis, by the way, explains the terminology \"even\" and uodd\" used for functions..\nSolution. We have to show (6) and (7) hold for polynomials with respectively only even\nor odd powers, but this follows immediately from the fact that for any non-negative integer\nn,.we have\ne\nifniseven,\n-e\",\nif n isodd.\nThe following easily proved rules predict the odd- or even-ness of the product or quotient\nof two odd or even functions:\n(8)\neven- even = even\nodd odd = even\nodd. even = odd\n(9)\neven/even = even\nodd/odd =even\nodd/even = odd\nExample 6.\nis of the form odd/even, therefore it is odd;\n(3 + x4)1/2(X - s)\nhas the form even odd, so it is odd.\n4. The trigonometric functions.\n... e trigonometric functions offer further illustrations of the ideas about translation,\nchange of scale, and symmetry that we have been discussing. Your book reviews the standard\nfacts about them in section 9.1, which you should refer to as needed.\nThe graphs of sinx and cos are crudely sketched below. (In calculus, the variable s is\nalways to be in radians; review radian measure in section 9.1 if you have forgotten it. Briefly,\nthere are 2r radians in a 3600 angle, so that for example a right angle is r/2 radians.)\nAs the graphs suggest and the unit circle picture shows,\n(10)\ncos(-s) = cos\n(even function)\nsin(-s) = -sin\n(odd function).\nFrom the standard triangle at the right, one sees that\ncos(7r/2 - x) \"= sinz,\nL\n\nand since cos x is an even function, this shows thi\n(11.)\ncos(x- r/2) = sinx.\nFrom (11), we see that moving the graph\nof cosax to the right by r/2 units turns it\ninto the graph of sin z. (See picture.)\nThe trigonometric function\nI\n(12)\ntan x= cos X\nis also important; its graph is sketched at the right. It is an odd\nfunction, by (9) and (10), since it has the form odd/even.\nPeriodicity\nAix-important property of the trigonometric functions is that they repeat their values:\n(13)\nsin(x + 27) = sinx,\ncos(r + 2w) = cos\n.\nThis is so because x + 2wr and x represent in radians the same angle.\nFrom the graphical point of view, equations (13) say that if we move the graph of sin\nor cosax to the left by 2wr units, it will coincide with itself.\nFrom the function viewpoint, equations (13) say that sin x and cos xare periodicfunctions,\nwith period 2r. In general, let c > 0; we say that f(x) is periodic, with period c, if\n(14)\nf(x + c) = f ()\nfor all x, and\n(14')\nc is the smallest positive number for which (14) is true.\nBy rule (1), the graph of a periodic function having period c coincides with itself when it is\ntranslated c units to the left. If we replace x by x- c in (14), we see that the graph will also\ncoincide with itself if it is moved to the right by c units. But beware: if a function is made\nby combining other periodic functions, you cannot always predict the period. For example,\nalthough it is true that\ntan(m +2r)= tanx\nand\ncos2(x + 2r)= cos 2x ,\nthe period of both tan x and cosa2 is actually r,as the above figure suggests for tan x.\nThe general sinusoidal wave.\nThe graph. of sin i is referred to as a \"pure wave\" or a \"sinusoidal oscillation\". We now\nconsider to what extent we can change how it looks by applying the geometric operations\nof translation and scale change discussed- earlier.\na) Start with sin i, which, has period 2r and oscillates between 11.\nb) Stretch the y axis by the factor A > 0; by.(4) this gives A sin x,which has period 2r\nand oscillates between ±A.\nc) Shrink the x-axis by the factor k > 0; by (3), this gives Asin ks, which has period\n2r/k,since\n2x\nAsink( + 2 ) = Asin(kx + 2r) A sin kx.\nAsmk( +%-) =\nd) Move the graph 0 units to the right; by (1), this gives\nI\n\nG.

We call such\nconstants parameters;their value determines the shape and position of the wave.\nBy using trigonometric identities, it is possible to write (15) in another form, which also\nhas three parameters:\n(16)\na sinkx + bcoskc\nThe relation between the parameters in the two forms is:\n(17)\na = A cos ko,\nb= -Asin ck;\nA== a2+b2,\ntantik\n-b a\nProof of the equivalence of (15) and (16).\n(15)\n= (16): from the identity sin(a + 6) = sin acosf + cosasinfl, we get\nAsin(k(x - ~)) = Asin(kx - kl)= AcosckIsinkC- Asin klcoskc\nwhich has the form of (16), with the values for a and b given in (17).\n(16)\n±= (15): square the two equations on the left of (17) and add them; this gives\na2 + b2 = A (cos2 k# + sinckt) = A2 , showing that A = /aa +b 2 .\nIf instead we take the ratio of the two equations on the left of (17), we get -b/a = tan k#,\nas promised.\nExample 7.\nFind the period, frequency, amplitude, and phase angle of the wave\nrepresented by the functions\na) 2sin(3z - r/6)\nb) -2 cos(2x - r/2)\nSolution.\na) Writing the function in the form (15), we get 2sin3(x - r/18), which shows it has\nperiod 2r/3, frequency 3, amplitude 2, and phase angle r/18 (or 100).\nb) We get rid of the - sign by using - cos\n= cos(z - 7r) -\ntranslating the cosine\ncurve wr units to the right is the same as reflecting it in the z-axis (this is the best way to\nremember such relations). We get then\n-2 cos(2z -\nr/2) = 2.cos(2z - r/2-\nr)\n= 2sin(2z- r),\nby (11);\n= 2sin2(x - 7r/2).\n\nExample 8. Sketch the curve sin2z + cos 2z.\nSolution Transforming it into the form (15), we can get A and # by using (19):\nA=v;\ntan 20=-l -\n2 =135= 3r/4, ~\n=3Ir/8.\nSo the function is also representable as V2sin2(z - 3r/8); it is a wave of amplitude V2,9\nperiod r, frequncy 2, and phase angle 37r/8, and can be sketched using this data.\n5. Reflection in the diagonal line; inverse functions.\nAs our final geometric operation on graphs, we consider the effect of\nin the diagonal line p = z.\nThis reflection can be carried out by flipping the plane over about t]\ndiagonal line. Each point of the diagonal stays fixed; the z-and y-axes a\ninterchanged. The points (a,b) and (b,a) are interchanged, as the picts\nshnws_ because the two rectangles are interchanged.\nTo see the effect of this on the function, let's consider first a simple example.\nExample 9.\nIf the graph of f() = a,\nz > 0 is reflected in the diagonal, what\nfunction corresponds to the reflected graph?\nSolution. The original curve is the graph of the equation: p=-z 2 ,\na > 0.\nReflection corresponds to interchanging the two axes; thus the reflected curve is the graph\nof the equation:\nz = y,\ny 2 0.\nTo find the corresponding function, we have to express p explicitly in terms of z, which\nwe do by solving the equation for y:\ny = V,\nz _20 ; the restriction on a follows\nbecause if z = y and y 2 0, then x2 0 also.\n-y y O= nodiag\nXxb\n_=zo'=\n,\nRemarks.\n1.\nWhen we flip the curve about the diagonal line, we do not interchange the labels\non the z- and p-axes. The coordinate axes remain the same -\nit is only the curve that\nis moved (imagine it drawn on an overhead-projector transparency, and the transparency\nfipped over). This is analogous to our discussion in section 1 oftranslation, where the curve\nwas moved to the right, but the coordinate axes themselves remained unchanged.\n2. It was necessary in the previous example to restrict the domain of z in the original\nfunction z2 ,so that after being fipped, its graph was still the graph of a function. Ifwe\nhadn't, the flipped curve would have been a parabola.lying on its side; this is not the graph\nof a function, since it has two y-values over each z-value.\nThe function having the refected graph, p=\n,\na 2 0 is called the inerse fno\ntion to the original function p = z2, z 2 0. The general procedure may be represented\nschematically by:\n\nG. GRAPHING FUNCTIONS\ny= J(s)\n-\n=fAy)\ny= 9(m)\noriginal graph\nswitch x and y\nreflected graph\nsolve for y\nreflected graph\nIn this scheme, the equations z = f (y) and y = g(z) have the same graph; all that has been\ndone is to transform the equation algebraically, so that y appears as an explicit function\nof z. This function g(z) is called the inverse function to f(z) over the given interval; in\ngeneral it will be necessary to restrict the domain of f(x) to an interval, so that the reflected\ngraph will be the graph of a function.\nTo summarize: f(z) and g(z) are inverse functions if\n(i) geometically,the graphs of f(z) and g(z) are reflections of each other in the diagonal\nline y =z;\n(ii) analytically, = f (y) and y = g(z) are equivalent equations, either arising from the\nother by solving exIlicitly for the relevant variable.\nExample 10. Find the inverse function to\n,\na>>1.1.\nz-1\nSolution. We introduce a dependent variable y, then interchange z and y, getting\ns=\n-\ny>1.\nWe solve this algebraically for y, getting\n(20)\ny= 1+-,1\n>O.\n(The domain is restricted because if y > 1, then equation (20) implies that\nx > 0.) The right side of (20) is the desired inverse function. The graphs\nenra\nsptc-heod\nIt often happens that in determining the inverse to f(z), the equation\n(21)\n= f(y)\ncannot be solved explicitly in terms of previously known functions. In that case, the corre\nsponding equation\n(22)\n,= 9()\nis viewed as deftning the inverse function to f(z), when taken with (21).. Once again, care\nmust be taken to restrict the domain of f(z) as necessary to ensure that the relected will\nindeed define a function g(z), i.e., will not be multiple-valued. A typical example is the\nfollowing.\nExample 11. Find the inverse function to sinx.\nSolution. Considering its graph, we see that for the reflected graph to define afunction,\nwe have to restrict the domain. The most natural choice is to consider the restricted function\n(23) \"\ny= sinz,\n-ir/2 < s < w/2.\n\nExample 11. Find the inverse function to sin x.\nSolution. Considering its graph, we see that for the reflected graph to define a function,\nwe have to restrict the domain. The most natural choice is to consider the restricted function\n(23)\ny = sinx,\n.- r/2 < z < 7r/2.\n-\nThe inverse function is then denoted sin\nx, or sometimes Arcsin x; it is defined by the\npair of equivalent equations\n(24)\n=siny,\n-ir/2 < x < r/2\n=\ny=sin-lz, -1\nz<l1.\nThe domain [-1, 1] of sin - 1 is evident from the picture -\nit is the same as the range of\nsinx over [--r/2, r/2].\nAs examples of its values, sin- ' = r/2, since sinir/2 = 1; similarly, sin- ' 1/2 = r/6.\nCare is needed in handling this function. For example, substituting the left equation in\n(24) into the right equation says that\n(25)\nsin-1(siny) = y,\n-r/2 < y 5 x/2 .\nIt is common to see the restriction on y carelessly omitted, since the equation by itself seems\n\"obvious\". But without the restriction, it is not even true; for example if y =i,\nsin - 1(sin 7r) = 0.\n.1\nI\nExercises: Section 1A"

HEAVISIDE'S COVER-UP METHOD\nThe eponymous method was introduced by Oliver Heaviside as a fast way to do a decom\nposition into partial fractions. In 18.01 we need the partial fractions decomposition in order\nto integrate'rational functions (i.e., quotients of polynomials). In 18.03, it will be needed as\nan essential step in using the Laplace transform to solve differential equations, and in fact\nthis yvas more or less Heaviside's original motivation.\nThe cover-up method can be used to make a partial fractions decomposition of a rational\nfunction p-) whenever the denominator can be factored into distinct linearfactors.\nWe illustrate with an example; though simple, it should convince you that the method is\nworth learning.\nx-7\nExample 1. Decompose (\n1)( +2) into partial fractions.\nSolution. We know the answer will have the form\nx-7\nA\nB\n(x-1)(x+2)-\nx-1 +x+2\nTo determine A by the cover-up method, on the left-hand side we mentally remove (or cover\nup with a finger) the factor x - 1 associated with A, and substitute x = 1 into what's left;\nthis gives A:\nx-7\n1-7\n(2)\n((+2)x,=1 = -\n= -2= A.\n1+2\nSimilarly, B is found by covering up the factor x + 2 on the left, and substituting x = -2\ninto what's left. This gives\nx-7\n-2-7\nx -\n= 3 = B.\n(x - 1)\nI=-2\n-2-1\nThus, our answer is\nx-7\n-2\n(3)\n(X-x\nWX + 2)\n+ 3\n(3)\n(x-1)(x+2)\nx-1\nX -\n+ x+2\n-\n+2\nWhy does the method work? The reason is simple. The \"right\" way to determine A from\nequation (1) would be to multiply both sides by (z - 1); this would give\n(4)\nx-\nB\n(4)\n(x + 2) = A +\n+ 2(-1).\nNow if we substitute x = 1, what we get is exactly equation (2), since the term on the right\ndisappears. The cover-up method therefore is just any easy way of doing the calculation\nwithout going to the fuss of writing (4) -\nit's unnecessary to write the term containing B\nsince it will become 0 .\n\nF. COVER-UP METHOD\nIn general, if the denominator of the rational function factots into the product of distinct\nlinear factors:\np(z)\nA1\nA,\n( -al)(z -a2)..-(-a)\n=\nA -\n+ ...+ -ar, 4r\na\na ,\nx-a\nthen Ai is found by covering up the factor x - ai pn the left, and setting x = a4 in. the rest\nof the expression.\nExample 2. Decompose\ninto partial fractions.\nSolution. Factoring, x33 _ =. x( 2 - 1) = z(x - 1)(z + 1). By the cover-up method,\n-1\n1/2\n1/2\nz(=-1)(z+11)\nX\nX-1\nz+ '\nTo be honest, the real difficulty in all of the partial fractions methods (the cover-up\nmethod being no exception) is in factoring the denominator. Even the programs which do\n*symbolic integration, like Macsyma, or Maple, can only factor polynomials whose factors\nhave integer coefficients, or \"easycoefficients\" like V2.and therefore they can only integrate\nrational functions with \"easily-factored\" denominators. .(Of course, these are the only kind\nyou'll see in 18.01 or 18.03.),\nHeaviside's cover-up method also can be used even when the denominator doesn't factor\ninto distinct linear factors. To be sure, it gives only partial results, but these can often be\na big help. We illustrate.\n5z\nExample 3. Decompose\n5= +6\n\n(x2+4)(x - 2)\nSolution. We write\n.5z+6\nAz+B\nC\n(5\n2)\nX2 +4 + x-2\n( 2 + 4)-x(z-\nWe first determine C by the cover-up method, getting C = 2. Then A and B can be.found\nby the method of undetermined coefficients; the work is greatly reduced since we need to\nsolve only two simultaneous equations to find A and B, not three.\nFollowing this plan, using C = 2, we combine terms.on the right of (5) so that both sides\nhave the same denominator. The numerators must then also be equal, which gives us\n(6)\n5x+ 6= (Ax + B)(z - 2) + 2(X2 + 4).\nComparing the coefficients say of z 2 and of the constant terms on both sides of (6) then\ngives respectively the two equations\n0=A+2\nand\n6= -2B + 8,\nfrom which A =-2 and .B= 1\nIn using (6), one could have instead compared the coefficients of x, getting 5 = -2A+ B;\nthis provides a valuable check on the correctness of our values for A and B.\n\nF. COVER-UP METHOD\nIn Example 3, an alternative to undetermined coefficients would be to substitute two\nnumerical values for x into the original equation (5), say z = 0 and z = 1 (any values\nother than x = 2 are usable). Again one gets two simultaneous equations for A and B.\nThis method requires addition of fractions, and is usually better when only one coefficient\nremains to be determined (as in Example 4 below).\nStill another method would be to factor the denominator completely into linear factors,\nusing complex coefficients, and then use the cover-up method, but with complex numbers. At\nthe end, conjugate complex terms have to be combined in pairs to produce real summands.\nThe calculations are sometimes longer, and require skill with complex numbers.\nThe cover-up method can also be used if a linear factor is repeated, but there too it gives\njust partial results. It applies only to the highest power of the linearfactor. Once again, we\nillustrate.\nExample 4. Decompose ((X- 1)2(X +2)\nSolution. We write\nA\nB\nC\n(7)\n(\n)\n+2\n-\n+\n+\n(Z- 1)2(X + 2)\n(z- 1)2\nz- 1\nx+2\nTo find A cover up ( - 1)2 and set x = 1; you get A = 1/3. To find C,cover up z+2,and\nset x = -2; you get C = 1/9.\nThis leaves B which cannot be found by the cover-up method. But since A and C are\nalready known in (7), B can be found by substituting any numerical value (other than 1 or\n-2) for z in equation (7). For instance, if we put z = 0 and remember that A = 1/3 and\nC = 1/9, we get\n1/3\nB\n1/9\ni = -+-l+-2\nfrom which we see that B = -1/9.\nB could also be found by applying the method of undetermined coefficients to the equation\n(7); note that since A and C are known, it is.enough to get a single linear equation in order\nto determine B -\nsimultaneous equations are no longer needed.\nThe fact that the cover-up method works for just the highest power of the repeated linear\nfactor can be seen just as before. In the above example for instance, the cover-up method\nfor finding A is just a short way of multiplying equation (5) through by (x - 1)2 and then\nsubstituting z = 1 into the resulting equation.\nExercises 5E"

For example both of these two improper integrals converge:\n0\"\ndaz\nz+3xs +22 + 1'\nand\nz\nbut there is no explicit antiderivative for the second integral, and finding one for the first\nwould be a hairy exercise in partial fractions, even ifone were able to factor the denominator.\nInstead of explicit integration, therefore, we show they converge by using estimation\ninstead, comparing them with simpler integrals which are known to converge. Thus, for the\nfirst,\ns6 + 3Zs + 2\n+1\n-\n~'\nX> 0,\nso that\nJ\nd0\n\"\ndsz + <\nz*=E.\nx\n\nz+3X3+2X2+1\nSince the right hand integral converges, so does the left, which is smaller (but still positive).\nIn a similar way, for the second integral, we estimate\n~P,'FF\nX> 0,\nso that\nI F\nv& d <\n<i\nF-/-\n= 2.\nIn the same way we can show the divergence say of F. Zd+\nt\nthis last being equivalent to 2zs/ 2>\n, i.e., to 8z Z2\n+ 1; thus we get\nJ idz\n.1J*\nx dz+\n>\n.FI2 0\nWe call the general principle we are using here the\n\nINT. IMPROPER INTEGRALS\nComparison Test for Improper Integrals. If 0 < f(z) < g(z) for a 5 z < oo,\n(1)\ng()\nconverges\n(z) d converges;\n(1')\n)f\ncf(x) diverges\ng(x) dz divevrs\nj(1\ndz\n*\n))da\ndiverges.\nIn other words, if the area under g(z) is finite and .f(x) lies below g(x)\n8x1\n(but still over the x-axis), then the area under f(z) will be finite also. Or\nequivalently, if the area under f(x) is infinite, so is the area under g(z).\nIn using the test, the lower limit of integration is of no importance, since if a < b,\nf() dT =\nf (x)dx +\nf (z) di,\nso that\n(3)\nf(z) d, converges\n*\nf (x) d, converges.\nAs another example of the use of the comparison test, we recall one used to illustrate the\nSecond Fundamental Theorem (cf. p. FT.3):\ne- Z < e-\nfor z > 1,and therefore\ne-2 dz converges, since\ne-\"dz converges.\n(Here we use (3) above to shift the lower limit from I to 0; also the comparison test (1).)\nIn using the comparison test, we have to have some standard integrals that we know\nconverge or diverge, to use for comparison purposes. The most useful are:\n(4)\njd/\" ds converges if p > 1,diverges ifp\n1;\n(5)\ne\"\nconverges ifa > 0.\nIt is important to notice that in using the test, you must make the inequality go in the\nright direction, which means you must guess in advance whether the integral will converge\nor diverge. For example, to test\nzIr-,\nwe see that as z -\n00o,\nX\nzX\nz3\n-\niF\nx'\ns\nso from (4) we guess it will converge. Unfortunately, s-\n>\n,a\n_ 2, so we can't\nuse j\nas the comparison integral; however, only a slight change is needed:\nz\n-2s2<2\nX>2,\nas we see by cross-multiplying: z8 < 2zs - 4; thus our integral converges, using (1). D\n\n·\nINT. IMPROPER INTEGRALS\nImproper integrals of the second kind\nThe comparison test also works for improper integrals of the form\nf(x) dz,\nwhere\nlim f(z) = oo,\nand\nf (x)d,\nwhere\nlim f () = oo.\nSometimes these are called improper integrals ofthe second kind\n- the first kind being the previous type of improper integral, where\none of the limits of integration is oo or -oo.\nb\nFor improper integrals of the second kind, useful standard comparison integrals are\n(6)b\nJ, I\n(b- x)P\nnd\nJ+ (x\ndx\n- a)P'\nwhich converge if p < 1, diverge if p _ 1 . Note that this is just the\nopposite of (4). However, it's easy to remember which is which if you\nthink of the picture at the right, which compares the graphs for p < 1\nand\n> 1.\n------ 4r-\n--\nm-\nC\nExample. Test J\nfor convergence.\nSolution. The. integrand becomes infinite when x = 0 and when z = 2, but 2 is of no\nimportance, since it's not in the interval over which we are integrating. In making our guess\nas to convergence or divergence, we note that\n.X\nszy O+ .\nThus, according to (6) above, we expect convergence, and make the comparison\n<\n(7)\nWhere is (7) valid (if at all)? Crossmultiplying, it claims that\n2,\nVi5/2 - x\nor squaring, x< 2x- z 2, or X2 <.\nThis last inequality is true if 0 < z < 1, so we're safe, since this is the region of integration.\nSo we see by the comparison test above that our integral converges because according to\nf 1 dx\n(6), the integral\n-\nconverges.\nRemark. It isn't customary to include the + and - symbols in a+ and b- when one\nwrites integrals of the second kind. We only did it here to point out where they are improper,\nand on which side. It doesn't appear in the solutions to the exercises on improper integrals.\nExercises: Section 6B"

MEAN-VALUE THEOREM\nThere are two forms in which the Mean-value Theorem can appear;1 you should get\nfamiliar with both of them. Assuming for simplicity that f(z) is differentiable on an interval\nwhose endpoints are a and b, or a and z, the theorem says\nf(b) - f(a) =\nfor some c between a and b;\nb-a\nf(x) = f(a) + f'(c)(z - a),\nfor some c between a and x\nThe first form (1) has an intuitive geometric interpretation in terms of the slope of a\nsecant being equal to the slope of the graph at some point c. and in this form, it's easy to\ngive an intuitive argument for the theorem.\nThe second form (2) looks less intuitive, but all that has been done is to multiply both\nsides of (1). by b-a, transpose a term, and change the name of btd z. Now it's not a theorem\nabout slopes; instead, it says that the value of f at some point z can be estimated, provided\nyou know the value of f at some fixed point a, and have information about the size of f' on\nthe interval [a,z]. In other words, from information about f',we can get information about\nf. (Such information can also be gotten by integration; one can think of the Mean-value\nTheorem as a poor-person's substitute for integration.)\nThe special case of (1)in which f(a) = f(b) = 0 is. usually called Rolle's theorem; it says\nthat if f is differentiable on [a, b],\nf(a) =f(b) = 0\nSf'(c)= 0\nfor some c, where a < c < b.\nExercises: Section 2G\nIsee Simmons, p. 76"

PROPERTIES OF INTEGRALS\nFor ease in using the definite integral, it is important to know its properties.

SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM\n1. The Two Fundamental Theorems of Calculus\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus really consists of two closely related theorems,\nusually called nowadays (not very imaginatively) the First and Second Fundamental Theo\nrems. Of the two, it is the First Fundamental Theorem that is the familiar one used all the\ntime. It is the theorem that tells you how to evaluate a definite integral without having to\ngo back to its definition as the limit of a sum of rectangles.\nFirst Fundamental Theorem Let f(x) be continuous on [a, b]. Suppose there is a\nfunction F(x) such that f(x) = F'(x) . Then\nb\nb\n(1)\nf f()dx\nF(b) F(a). =\n)\n=\n-\nF(x)\n(The last equality just gives another way of writing F(b) - F(a)that is in widespread use.)\nStill another way of writing the theorem is to observe that F(x) is an antiderivative for f(x),\nor as it-is sometimes called, an indefinite integral for f(x); using the standard notation for\nindefinite integral and the bracket notation given above, the theorem would be written\n(1')\nf (x) dx = f (x)d\n.\nWriting the theorem this way makes it look sort of catchy, and more importantly, it avoids\nhaving to introduce the new symbol F(x) for the antiderivative.\nIn contrast with the above theorem, which every calculus student knows, the Second\nFundamental Theorem is more obscure and seems less useful. The purpose of this chapter is\nto explain it, show its use and importance, and to show how the two theorems are related.\nTo start things off, here it is.\nSecond Fundamental Theorem. Let f(x) be continuous, andfix a.\n(2)\nSet F() =\nf (t)dt;\nthen F'(x) = f(x).\nWe begin by interpreting (2) geometrically. Start with the graph of f(t)\nin the ty-plane. Then F(x) represents the area under f(t) between a and\nx; it is a function' of x. Its derivative -\nthe rate of change of area with\nrespect to x -\nis the length of the dark vertical line. This is what (2) says\ne met.ricrnll\nISimmons calls this function A(x) on p. 207 (2nd edition); this section of Simmons is another presentation\nof much of the material given here.\n\nExample 1. Verify (2) if f(x) = 2xsin 2 and a= 0.\nSolution. Here we can integrate explicitly by finding an antiderivative (using the first\nfundamental theorem):\nF(W) =\n2tsintdt\n- cos t2\n-cosx\n+ 1;\ndifferentiating by the chain rule, we verify that indeed F'(x) = 2zsinx 2, as predicted by\n(2).\nO\n*Example2. Let F(z) =\nSsint dt.\nFind F'(7r/2).\nSolution.\nNeither integration techniques nor integral tables will produce an explicit\nantiderivative for the function in the integrand. So we cannot use (1). But we can use (2),\nwhich says that\nsin 7r/2\nF'(R/2) = i/2\n/2\nMany students feel the Second Fundamental Theorem is \"obvious\"; these students are\nconfusing it with the similar-looking\n(2')\nLet F(x) =\nf f(x) dx;\nthen F'(x) = f(x).\nIndeed, (2') is obvious. The \"integral\" in it is an indefinite integral, i.e., an antiderivative.\nSo what (2') says is: \"Let F(x) be an antiderivative for f (x); then F(x) is an antiderivative\nfor f(x) -\na true statement, but not a very exciting one (logicians call it a tautology.)\nThe Second Fundamental Theorem (2) looks almost the same as (2'), but it is actually\nentirely different, because F(x) is defined as a definite integral. The next section, which\ncontinues the discussion, should help show the difference.\n2. Do functions have antiderivatives?\nThe First Fundamental Theorem tells us how to calculate\nf(x) dx by finding an anti\nderivative for f(x). But the theorem isn't so useful if you can't find an antiderivative. Most\ncalculus students think for example that e'-\nhas no antiderivative -\n\"the integral isn't\nin the tables\", \"it can't be integrated\" are some of the ways they express this. Even for a\nsimple function like 11-\n, it is not obvious what the antiderivative is. Perhaps it doesn't\nhave any?\nThe Second Fundamental Theorem provides the answer; it says:\nEvery contiziuous function f(x) has an antoiderivative:\nf(t)dt.\nThe antiderivative may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions -\nthis is the\ndifficulty with e- \"2 -\nbut it always exists.\n\nFT. THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM\nExample 3. Find an antiderivative for\nSolution. This doesn't look so easy to do explicitly. But the Second Fundamental Theorem\nsays the following function is an antiderivative:\n(3) ..\nF(z).-\ndt\nDiscussion.\nYou may feel that this doesn't represent progress: the formula for the\nantiderivative is useless. But that's not so: the function F(z) can be calculated by numerical\nintegration. It can be programmed into a calculator so that when you press an z-value, the\nscreen will display the corresponding value of F(z) to 12 decimal digits. Pressing another\nbutton will draw the graph of F(z) over any interval on the z-axis that you specify.\nRepeating what we said earlier, the integral in (3) should be carefully distinguished from\ndz -\nthis \"integral\" is just another notation for the antiderivative, and is\ntherefore not a solution to the problem. The integral in (3) by contrast is a perfectly\ndefinite function, and it does solve the problem of finding an antiderivative..\nIn this case, it turns out that F(z) does have an expression in terms of elementary\nfunctions. It is\n(4)\nF(z) =\n(f+ 1)3/8-4(v +1)1'\n(You can prove this is correct by differentiating it; the 8/3 is put in to ensure that F(O) = 0,\nas definition (3)requires.)\nThe above way of writing F(z) is different from (3). Whether or not it is a better way\ndepends on what you want to know about F(.) and what use you want to make of it. For\ninstance,\nIs F(z) > 0 when z > 07\nThe answer is clearly \"yes\" if we look at the integral (3), since the integrand is positive; it\nis not at all clear what the answer is if instead we look at (4), because of the - sign. As\n.another example, what is F'(z) ? From (3) the answer is immediate, whereas from (4) you\nwould have to calculate for a while -\nas you will know if you took the trouble to check its\ncorrectnessl\n\n3. Defining new functions: In(x) and erf(x).\nOne important use of the Second Fundamental Theorem is to define new functions. Cal\nculus can then be used to study their properties.\nTo illustrate, we consider first an old function: Inz.Let's pretend we know nothing of\nlogarithms. We do know that\nSXd = n+l'\nno-1 .\nHowever, we know no explicit formula for an antiderivative of 1/x, i.e., when n = -1.\nWe therefore use the Second Fundamental Theorem to define an antiderivative of 1/z,\nnamely\n(5)\nL(x) =\nd\n(We use 1 as the lower limit of integration since the integrand is not defined at 0.) What\nare the properties of this function?\nProperties of L(x) =\ndt\nL-1. L(x) is defined for x > 0 (since 1/t is continuous for t > 0);\nL-2. L(1) = 0;\nL-3. L'(x) = 1/x, by the Second Fundamental Theorem;\nL-4. L\"(z) = -I/za, by differentiating 1/x;\nL-5. L(x) is increasing for all z > 0, since L'(x) > 0; its graph is concave (i.e., concave\ndown) since L\"(s) > 0;\nL-6. L(ab) =L(a) +L(b).\nOf course, it is this last which is the interesting property; the proof of it is elegant.\nProof of L-6. We break up the integral defining L(ab) into two parts, the first of which\nis L(a): to do this, we use the ihiterval addition rule (3) in Notes PI.1 .\n(6)\nL(ab)\na -d = =tIT +\nab dt\nComparing with Property L-6, we see we have to show the last integral on the right above\nhas the value L(b). To see this, make the change of variable t = au and apply the change\nof'variable rule (see (7), p. PI.2 in these notes). You get successively\ndt\nadu\ndo\nt= au,\ndt = adu,\nt\nau\ndu\nt\natu\n*u\nWe have to change the limits on the integral also: t = a and t = ab correspond respectively\nto u = 1,u = b. Thus the rule for changing variable in a definite integral gives\njabdt\ndu\n=\n\nFT. THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM\nwhich proves L-6.\nO\nOnce we have this, the other properties of the logarithm follow in a standard way.\nL-7. L(1/a) = -L(a), since L(1/a)+ L(a) = L(! - a) = L(1) = 0 .\nL-8.\nlim L(z) = oo; namely, L(z) is incrieasing and L(2\") increases without bound as\nn--+oo, since L(2\") = nL(2), by Property 6; note that L(2) > 0since f(z) is increasing. 0\nIn our definition of L(x), the number e appears as the unique number such that\nL(e) =\n=\n1.\nSuch a number exists by the Intermediate Value Theorem,2 since L(z) is increasing, contin\nuous (since it has a derivative), and gets bigger than 1.\nWe now turn to a second example of using the Second Fundamental Theorem to define\na function F(x) -\nthis time, the function will be genuinely new. It is closely related to\nan important function in probability and statistics, the error function erf x. (Statistics\noriented calculators have a button for it.) The two functions differ only by a change of scale\non the x- and y-axes. There is no simpler or more elementary expression for F(x).\nExample 5. Define a function F(z) by F(z) =\ne-' dt.\nSketch the graph of F(x), indicating relative maxima and minima', points of inflection,\nsaAmmeatrie.\nRatimQ+a\nP(1) ro 1 C&hlJ\ne-t\nSolution. The graph of f(t) = e- t is shown.\n/\nF(z) is the indicated shaded area under the graph of f(t).\nx\n2...\n-.\n-.\n.-\n-.\n..\n..\n..\n.\n-\nF'(x) = e\nby the Second Fundamental Theorem; since the exponential\npositive, this shows F(z) is increasing for all x, and therefore it has no relative ,\nminima.\nF\"(z) = -2xe- 2 ;since F\"(z) < 0 for z > 0, the graph of F(x) is\nconcave (down) when x > 0. Similarly, it is convex (concave up) for z < 0,\nand it h\na po\n=\nnint of inflection at x\n-\nF(z) is an odd function. To see this, we note that e 2 is an even function. As the\npicture shows, the.two shaded areas are equal; the one on the left however must be counted\nnegatively, since the integration is backwards: if z > 0, then\n'4y\n-=_r\nI\nF(., A.\n-\nI\nflt~ fIt\n'&\n-x\nI\nW-- =J\n-- Jo\n),I\n=j.--\nJof\n-+.... -WM.\n-X I\nThis shows F(x) is an odd function.\ne\nF(1) can be estimated as the area under f(t) between 0 and 1; it is\nroughly comparable to the area of the trapezoid shown, which about .7.\n2Simmons, p. 78\n\n4. Proof of the two Fundamental Theorems.\nWe will give an intuitive argument.for the Second Fundamental Theorem, and then\ndeduce the First Fundamental Theorem from the Second. Though the argument for the\nSecond Theorem is only suggestive, it has the right ideas in it, and can be easily made\nrigorous if you have available a precise definition of limit.3\n.-\nSecond Fundamental Theorem: Intuitive Argument\nWe wish to prove that if f (s) is continuous, then\nWe calculate F'(s)using the definition of derivative. Let a change by Az,\nandt let. AF be.the corresponding change in F(-s). From the picture.\nAF = F(x + Ax) - F(c) = j\nf(t) dt\n(9)\na f(s)Az,\nsince the area of the vertical strip under the curve is approximately the same as the area of\nthe rectangle. Dividing, we have\nAF\nwhere the error in the approximation is bounded by the height of the small curved triangle.\nSince .f(t)is continuous, the error is small compared with f(x), and disappears when we\npass to the limit as Ax --0; we get therefore\nF'(x) = lim\n= f(x).\nNote that if f(t) were discontinuous at the point x, the result would not be true; as the\npicture shows, the approximation in (9) would not be true.\nFirst Fundamental Theorem: Proof4\nWe want to show that if f(z) is continuous and f(x)'= F'(x), then\n(10)\nf(x) dz = F(b)- F(a).\nWe begin by defining\n(11)\n(z)=\nf (t) dt;\nthen\nG'(x) = f(x),\nby the Second Fundamental Theorem.\n3A somewhat fuller argument is given in Simmons, Step 1, p. 206-7.\n4this same classical reasoning is given in Simmons: Steps' 2 and 3, p. 207.\n\nFT. THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM\nSince G'(x) = f(x) = F'(x), we have (G(x) - F(s))' = 0, which implies G(x) - F(x) = C,\ni.e.,\n(12)\nG(x) = F(x) + C,\nfor some constant C.\nTo evaluate C, we put x = a in (12); since G(a) = 0, we get\nC = --F(a).\nFinally, put x = b in equation (12), and use the above value for C:\nG(b) = F(b)- F(a),\nwhich is exactly (10), in view of the definition of G(x).\nO\nRemark. Both fundamental theorems say that differentiation and definite integration\nare inverse operations: each undoes what the other does. In the First Fundamental Theorem\nwe differentiate, then integrate:\nF(x) --\nF'(x)\nF'(t)dt= F(x) -F(a);\nIn the Second Fundamental Theorem, we integrate, then differentiate:\nf(t) ---\nf)\n-W\ndA\nd\nf(t) dt = f(x) .\nIn both cases, the theorem says that we end up essentially where we started - only \"essen\ntially\" because of the additive constant in F(x).\n(Of course, differentiation and indefinite integration are also inverse operations, but this\nis trivial - it's just a restating of the definition of indefinite integration.)\nExercises: Section 3D"

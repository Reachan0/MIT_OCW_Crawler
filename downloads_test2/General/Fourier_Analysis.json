ISBN: 9780521251204.\n\nThis book is a series of vignettes that make entertaining reading in small doses. We will not be using it, but it gives an idea of the range of applications of Fourier analysis.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course continues the content covered in\n18.100 Analysis I\n. Roughly half of the subject is devoted to the theory of the Lebesgue integral with applications to probability, and the other half to Fourier series and Fourier integrals.\n\nThe task in the first half of the course is to introduce Lebesgue measure and establish properties of the Lebesgue integral. Our textbook (Adams and Guillemin) introduces Lebesgue measure using motivation and examples from probability theory. After we have developed probability theory on Bernoulli sequences, using a corresponding with Lebesgue measure on the unit interval, we will discuss the Lebesgue integral and some Fourier analysis. Then we will use some Fourier analysis to prove more theorems in probability. By the end of the semester we will have all the tools to discuss the continuum limit of a (suitably scaled) random walk, namely Brownian motion.\n\nOne of the main goals this course is to establish rules for the limiting behavior of functions so that we can deal with functions with as much confidence as we do real or complex numbers. An equally important motivation (that will only become clear in the second half) is that the systematic study of Fourier series requires the Lebesgue integral. The square mean convergence of Fourier series and Parseval's formula cannot be stated accurately in proper generality without the Lebesgue integral and Lebesgue integrable functions.\n\nAssignments and Exams\n\nThere will be 11 problem sets, due at the beginning of class on the due dates. Late homework will be accepted only if it is turned in within one week of the due date. There is no penalty for the first late homework assignment, but scores of all subsequent late papers will be multiplied by 1/2. Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, but read each problem carefully and make an attempt to solve it by yourself. You must write up all homework problems by yourself.\n\nThere will be one in-class midterm test and a final exam.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem sets\n\n30%\n\nMidterm exam\n\n30%\n\nFinal exam\n\n40%\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nCoin Tossing, Law of Large Numbers, Rademacher Functions\n\nProblem Set 1 Due\n\nMeasure Theory, Random Models\n\nProblem Set 2 Due\n\nMeasurable Functions, Lebesgue Integral\n\nProblem Set 3 Due\n\nConvergence Theorems, Riemann Integrability\n\nProblem Set 4 Due\n\nFubini's Theorem, Independent Random Variables\n\nProblem Set 5 Due\n\nLebesgue Spaces, Inner Products\n\nProblem Set 6 Due\n\nHilbert Space, Midterm Review\n\nMidterm Test\n\nFourier Series and their Convergence\n\nProblem Set 7 Due\n\nApplications of Fourier Series\n\nProblem Set 8 Due\n\nFourier Integrals\n\nProblem Set 9 Due\n\nFourier Integrals of Measures, Central Limit Theorem\n\nProblem Set 10 Due\n\nBrownian Motion\n\nProblem Set 11 Due\n\nBrownian Motion Concluded, Review for Final Exam\n\nFinal Exam",

Show that\n∥f ∗g∥p ≤∥f∥p∥g∥1\nHint: Let 1/p + 1/q = 1, and apply H older's inequality to\n|f(x -y)g(y)| = (|f(x -y)||g(y)|1/p)(|g(y)|1/q)\n(See Prop 17, AG Appendix B.) Note that this inequality is also true for p = 1, using\nFubini's theorem carried out in §3.5/9, and for p = inf, using more elementary properties of\nthe Lebesgue integral.\nb) Deduce that if f ∈Lp(R), 1 ≤p < infand K ∈L1(R) with\nZ\nR\nK(x) dx = 1;\nKε(x) = (1/ε)K(x/ε)\nthen\nlim\nε→0 ∥f ∗Kε -f∥p = 0\nc) Show that if f ∈Linf(R) and K ∈L1(R), then f ∗K ∈Cucb(R), where Cucb(R) is the\nclass of uniformly continuous functions bounded functions. (See also Fourier series notes 3,\nwhere the analogous statement on T is mentioned as an exercise, with a hint as to how it is\nproved.)\nd) Give a counterexample to the statement in part b) in the case p = inf.\n2. We will solve the equation\n∂\n∂tu = ∂2\n∂x2u + a ∂\n∂xu\n(1)\nfor a function u(x, t) with initial value\nu(x, 0) = f(x).\nThis is interpreted as a heat equation or diffusion equation with drift (the a(∂/∂x) term is\nthe drift).\na) Denote by ˆu(ξ, t) and ˆf(ξ) the Fourier transform in the x variable of u and f. For each\nfixed ξ find the ordinary differential equation for ˆu(ξ, t) formally (assuming the derivatives\nall make sense). Then solve the equation for ˆu in terms of ˆf.\n\nb) Take the inverse Fourier transform of your formula for ˆu(ξ, t) in part (a), and find a\nproposed formula for u in terms of f in the form\nu(x, t) = f ∗gt(x)\n(See §3.5/10 for the formula for gt in the case a = 0.)\nc) Show that the formula in part (b) solves the initial value problem.

(This extends by\ncontinuity to L2(R). Recall that we proved in lecture that T maps S to S. The Plancherel\nformula says that T is an isometry in the L2(R) norm. We also showed in lecture that, since\nS is dense in L2, one can extend T by continuity to the whole space L2(R), where it is again\nan isometry.)\nb) Suppose that h ∈S and Th = ch (an eigenvector for T with eigenvalue c). Find the short\nlist of possible values of c.

Use part (c) and the commutator formula [A, Bn] = ncBn-1.\nIncidentally, the Hermite polynomials can also be obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt\nprocess to the functions 1, x, x2, x3, etc, in L2(R, e-x2dx).)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.103 Fourier Analysis\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Consider f : R →R monotone increasing, i. e. x ≤y =⇒f(x) ≤f(y).\nFor -inf< a < b < inf, define\nνf((a, b)) = lim\nε→0+(f(b -ε) -f(a + ε))\nThe same proof as in the construction of Lebesgue measure shows that νf is a measure on\nthe ring of finite unions of intervals and extends to a measure on Borel sets. νf is sometimes\ndenoted df. (Thus, in the special case f(x) = x, we get Lebesgue measure νx = dx.)\na) Show that, conversely, for any measure μ on R that assigns a finite (nonnegative) number\nto each compact set there is a left continuous function f such that μ = νf. Left continuous\nmeans\nlim\nx→a-f(x) = f(a)\nand x →a-means x →a with x < a.\nb) Suppose that f is monotone increasing. Show that f is continuous at all but (at most)\ncountably many points xj. Find a continuous monotone increasing function g such that\nνf = νg +\nX\ncjδ(x -xj),\ncj = f(x+\nj ) -f(x-\nj )\nThe sum of delta functions is called the pure point or atomic part of the measure νf, and νg\nis the continuous part.\nc) Consider the Cantor function defined for each sequence ak ∈{0, 1} by\nC(x) =\nN-1\nX\nk=1\nak2-k + 2-N,\n3-N ≤x -2\nN-1\nX\nk=1\nak3-k ≤2 · 3-N\nShow that C can be extended uniquely to a continuous monotone increasing function on R\nsatisfying C(x) = 0 for all x ≤0 and C(x) = 1 for all x ≥1. Denote the corresponding\nCantor measure by dC = μC. Show that μC is supported on the Cantor set. In other words\nμC(E) = 0 for any E ⊂R such that E is disjoint from the standard middle third Cantor set.\nd) Let\nμ1 ∗μ2 ∗· · · ∗μn;\nwith μk = (1/2)[δ(x) + δ(x -2/3k)]\nFrom part (a) there is a monotone, left continuous function Cn such that Cn(x) = 0 for\nx ≤0 and dCn = μ1 ∗· · · ∗μn.

In other words, we have constructed a continuous measure whose Fourier transform\ndoes not tend to zero at infinity.\n2. We say a function f : R →R has bounded variation or f is a BV function, if there is\nM < inffor which\nN\nX\nk=1\n|f(xk) -f(xk-1)| ≤M\nfor every sequence x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xN and every N.\na) Show that a function f of bounded variation on R is continuous except at countably many\npoints, and identify a left continuous function g that agrees with f at all but countably many\npoints. Give an example showing that g may have smaller total variation than f.\nb) Show that a left continuous function g of bounded variation can be written\ng(x) = h1(x) -h2(x)\nwith h1 and h2 left continuous, monotone increasing, and bounded. Hint: For x > 0, define\ng+(x) = sup{\nn\nX\nj=1\n[g(xj) -g(xj-1)]+ : 0 < x0 < x1 < · · · xn ≤x};\ng-(x) = sup{\nn\nX\nj=1\n[g(xj) -g(xj-1)]-: 0 < x0 < x1 < · · · xn ≤x}\nwhere a+ = max(a, 0) and a-= max(-a, 0).\nc) Consider g as in part (b). Show that for every φ ∈S,\n-\nZ\nR\nφ′(x)g(x) dx =\nZ\nR\nφ dh1 -\nZ\nR\nφ dh2\nThis says, by definition, that the generalized derivative of g is dh1 -dh2.\nd) The procedure in parts (b) and (c) works for all functions of bounded variation, not just\nones that are left continuous. Write down explicit monotone increasing functions h1 and h2\nsuch that f(x) = h1(x) -h2(x) for\nf(x) =\n\nx < 0\nx = 0\nx > 0\n\nand calculate the generalized derivative f ′. Alternatively, find g left continuous that agrees\nwith f except at one point and apply (b) and (c) to g. Compare the generalized derivative\ng′ with f ′. Are they the same?\n3. (Shannon sampling theorem; Stein-Shakarchi Problem 20) A function f is called band-\nlimited if its Fourier transform is supported on an interval of length L.\nWe show that\nband-limited functions whose frequencies come from an interval of length L can be recovered\nfrom values spaced by 2π/L. By dilation and translation we may assume that L = 2π and\ncenter the interval of frequencies around 0.\na) Let f ∈L2(R) be such that ˆf is supported on [-π, π]. Show that f is continuous. (More\nprecisely, f has a continuous representative which we will use from now on.)\nb) Show that f from part (a) satisfies\nZ inf\n-inf\n|f(x)|2 dx =\ninf\nX\n-inf\n|f(n)|2\nand\nˆf(ξ) = 1[-π,π](ξ)\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nf(n)e-inξ\nin the sense of L2(R)-norm convergence.\nc) Show that\nf(x) =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nf(n)K1(x -n)\nfor K1 from optional Problem 5 below. In the course of the proof, explain why the series\nconverges for every x. (Warning: You may carry out the computation formally first. But\nwhen you justify the appropriate exchange of limits, remember that you only have norm\nconvergence in L2.)\nd) One can also recover f from more densely spaced samples. Show that\nf(x) =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nλf\nx\nλ\n\nKλ\n\nx -n\nλ\n\n,\nwith Kλ from Problem 5. Note that Kλ(y) = O(y-2) so that this series converges faster than\nthe one in (c).\n4. In this problem we deduce the Fourier series/inversion formula from its discrete analogue\non Z/NZ.\na) Consider f ∈C(R/2πZ) and xN(j) = 2πj/N.

Carry out the following steps to prove\n|cN(n)| ≤max |f ′′|/n2\n(2)\ni) Let g : Z →C satisfying g(j + N) = g(j). For n ∈Z, let ω = e2πin/N and define\nF(ω) = 1\nN\nN\nX\nj=1\ng(j)ω-j\nShow that\n(ω + ω-1 -2)F(ω) = 1\nN\nN\nX\nk=1\n(g(j + 1) + g(j -1) -2g(j))ω-j\nand deduce that for |n| ≤3N/4,\n|F(ω)| ≤N 2\nn2 max\nj\n|g(j + 1) + g(j -1) -2g(j)|\nii) Show that for f ∈C2(R/2πZ),\n|f(x + h) + f(x -h) -2f(x)| ≤h2 max |f ′′|\n\nusing the Taylor formula\nm(1) = m(0) + m′(0) +\nZ 1\nm′′(t)(1 -t) dt\napplied to m(t) = f(x + th) + f(x -th) -2f(x).\niii) Deduce (2) from (i) and (ii).\ne) Explain how (a)-(d) yield the Fourier series formula for every function f ∈C2(R/2πZ).\n5. This optional problem for no credit is here so that you can use the formulas from it to\ncarry out the Shannon sampling theorem above in Problem 3. We begin by showing that\nthe convolution of L2 functions is compatible with the Fourier transform, then compute the\nexplicit example used for Shannon's theorem.\na) Let f and g belong to L2(R). Denote\ngN(x) = 1\n2π\nZ N\n-N\nˆg(ξ)eixξ dξ\nShow that\nd\n(fg) = 1\n2π\nˆf ∗ˆg\nby evaluating\nlim\nN→inf\nZ inf\n-inf\nf(x)gN(x)e-ixξ dx\nin two ways.\nb) Let Ia(y) = 1[-a,a](y). For 0 < h ≤a, find Ja,h(x) such that\nˆJa,h(ξ) = Ia ∗Ih(ξ)\nc) Deduce from part (b) the formula for the function Kλ(x) of the form\nKλ(y) = C sin(Ay) sin(By)\ny2\n,\nλ > 1\nwhose Fourier transform has the trapezoidal shape\nˆKλ(ξ) =\n\n1,\n|ξ| ≤π\n(λπ -|ξ|)/π(λ -1),\nπ ≤|ξ| ≤πλ\n0,\nπλ ≤|ξ|\nIndeed, A = π(λ -1), B = π(λ + 1), C = 2/π2(λ -1). (See Stein-Shakarchi Problem 20, p.\n167-168. But be warned that our convention for the Fourier transform is different, and the\nformula there is written with cosines, not sines.)\n\nd) Evaluate Kλ(0) and show that\nK1(y) = lim\nλ→1 Kλ(y).\n6. This optional exercise shows how to construct a countable family of independent random\nvariables.\nIt's taken from the book Probability Theory, by D. W. Stroock.\nConsider a\ncountable sequence of probability spaces (Xn, Fn, μn). Define the ring of so-called cylinder\nsets, namely sets of the form B × Xn+1 × Xn+2 × · · · with B ∈F1 × F2 × · · · Fn.\nTheorem. There exists a unique measure μ on the cylinder ring satisfying\nμ(B × Xn+1 × Xn+2 × · · · ) = μ1 × μ2 × · · · × μn(B)\nFollow this outline to prove the theorem. Define X =\ninf\nY\nj=1\nXj, and define the projection\nπn : X →X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn,\nby\nπn(x) = (x1, x2, . . . , xn)\na) Show that the theorem follows if one shows that any nested sequence An ⊃An+1 in the\ncylinder ring, for which\nlim inf\nn→infμ(An) ≥ε > 0\nalso satisfies\ninf\n\\\nn=1\nAn = ∅\nb) Show that it suffices to consider the situation in which for some Bn ∈F1 × · · · × Fn, the\nnested sequence satisfies\nAn = π-1\nn (Bn);\nBn × Xn+1 ⊃Bn+1\nc) Define gm,m(x1, x2, . . . , xm) = 1Bm(x1, x2, . . . , xm). For all n > m, define\ngm,n : X1 × X2 × · · · × Xm →[0, 1] by\ngm,n(x1, x2, . . . , xm) =\nZ\nXm+1×···×Xn\n1Bn(x1, x2, . . . xn)d(μm+1 × · · · × μn)\nShow that the limit\ngm(x) := lim\nn→infgm,n(x),\nx = (x1, . . . , xm)\nexists and that\ngm(x1, . . . , xm) =\nZ\nXm+1\ngm+1(x1, . . . , xm+1)dμm+1\n\nd) Use induction to find x = (x1, x2, . . . ) ∈X such that for every m,\ngm(x1, x2, . . . , xm) ≥ε\nand deduce that\nx ∈\ninf\n\\\nm=1\nAm\nThis establishes (a) and concludes the construction of the infinite product measure.\ne) The monotone class theorem says that if M is a collection of subsets of a set Z that is\nclosed under nested countable union and nested countable intersection and contains a ring\nA, then M contains the sigma-ring generated by A. (The theorem does not say whether the\nwhole set Z is in M, but in our situation Z ∈A, so that the collection of subsets will be a\nsigma-field.) Show that this result implies that the measure constructed above is the unique\nmeasure on the sigma field generated by cylinder sets that agrees with the finite product\nmeasures. (You may take the monotone class theorem for granted or prove it. It's a bit\neasier than the π -λ theorem, but in the same spirit.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.103 Fourier Analysis\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "18.103 Fall 2013\nMidterm Review\nThe main topics so far have been\n1. The construction of Lebesgue measure\n2. The Lebesgue integral, convergence theorems and Fubini's theorem\n3. Applications\na) Probability theory\nb) Lebesgue Lp(X, μ) spaces are complete.\nc) Cinf\n0 (Rn) is dense in Lp(Rn), 1 ≤p < inf.\nd) Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma (follows from density).\ne) Fourier representation of 2π-periodic L2 functions\n(i. e., einx, n ∈Z is a complete orthonormal system).\nThe key to constructing Lebesgue measure is to confirm that volume is countably additive\non the rectangle ring. See Theorem 7, §1.3, and Exercise §1.1/21.\nNote that for measurable sets E and F,\n∥1E -1F∥1 =\nZ\nX\n|1E -1F| dμ = μ(S(E, F))\nwhere S(E, F) = (E -F) ∪(F -E) is the set-theoretical symmetric difference. Thus for\nmeasurable sets, the distance d(E, F) = μ∗(S(E, F)) is the same as the L1(X, μ) distance\nbetween the indicator functions 1E and 1F. After the basic key consistency property men-\ntioned in the last paragraph, the rest of the process we went through to construct Lebesgue\nmeasure is essentially the same as the process of completing any metric space. Thus an\nalternative definition of L1 is as the completion under the L1 distance of step functions (or\nRiemann integrable functions or continuous functions). In the abstract, the completion pro-\ncess yields equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. The advantage of our present approach\nis that we can identify the limits as actual sets and functions.\nAlthough in the Lebesgue approach the limiting objects are actual functions, not just equiv-\nalence classes of Cauchy sequences, we still have to get used to some ambiguity. The mea-\nsurable sets and integrable functions we obtain as limits are certainly more satisfying than\nequivalence classes, but we still pay the price that they are only defined up to a set of measure\nzero. Since Lebesgue's time, we have figured out many ways to deal with that inconvenience\nand get back to \"classical\" statements involving continuous functions and functions with\ndefinite values at points of interest. We will learn some of these in the second half of the\ncourse.\n\nHour Test\nThe 50-minute test in class on Friday, October 25, covers Sections 1.1 through 3.3 of the\ntext by Adams and Guillemin, except Section 2.8. It also covers the notes that have been\nposted. Here is a rough description of the types of problems, followed by last year's test.\nIn all cases of proofs you should be ready to state carefully not only the theorem you are\nproving but also the ingredients in the proof.\n1. Establish the main step in the Lebesgue measure construction, that is, confirm that μ∗\nequals the volume measure on the rectangle ring.\n2. Prove one of these convergence theorems. (I will pick one.)\na) The monotone convergence theorem\nb) Fatou's lemma\nc) The dominated convergence theorem\n3. Prove or establish a step or two in the proof of one of the following theorems.\na) Borel-Cantelli Lemma 1 or 2\nb) Bounded measurable functions are uniform limits of simple functions.\nc) Bounded Riemann integrable functions are Lebesgue integrable with the same value.\nd) L1(X, μ) is complete.\n4 + 5. Questions in which you have to decide what's true and why. You will be given state-\nments related to limit theorems, Fubini's theorem, or issues of integrability or measurability.\nMost students find these to be the trickiest questions because of the uncertainty. They are\nnot designed to be devious, but you need to come to the test armed with examples related\nto where the hypotheses of the theorems do and don't work.\n6. The last question is up for grabs. It may include a computation or the evaluation of a\nlimit as an application of any of our theorems. For example,\na) A computation with Rademacher functions.\nb) Use of E(f1f2 · · · fn) = E(f1)E(f2) · · · E(fn) for independent random variables.\nc) Computation of the probability distribution μf given an explicit function f.\nd) Evaluation of a limit using a convergence theorem, Fubini's theorem, or density of\nsmooth functions in Lp functions, 1 ≤p < inf.\ne) Evaluation of a probability using a Borel-Cantelli lemma\nLast year's test, on the next page, follows the rubric above.\n\nPRACTICE HOUR TEST (Throughout, μ denotes Lebesgue measure on R.)\n1.

The main mathematical goal is to learn about the fundamental group, homology and cohomology. The main non-mathematical goal is to obtain experience giving math talks. Lectures will be delivered by the students, with two students speaking at each class. There are no exams. There will be some homework assignments and a final paper.\n\nTextbooks\n\nHatcher, Allen.\nAlgebraic Topology\n. Cambridge University Press, 2001. ISBN: 9780521795401. [Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nThis book is also available for free online at\nAllen Hatcher's webpage\n.\n\nMassey, William S.\nA Basic Course in Algebraic Topology\n. Springer-Verlag, 1991. ISBN: 9783540974307.\n\nGrading\n\nThe final grade is determined as follows:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nLectures and participation\n\n60%\n\nFinal paper\n\n30%\n\nProblem sets\n\n10%\n\nAttendance is mandatory. Every three missed classes will result in the drop of a letter grade; thus one can miss up to two classes with no effect on the grade.\n\nLectures and Participation\n\nEach class two students will give lectures. Each lecture should be about 25 minutes long. Individual lectures will not be graded, but lectures make up a good portion of the final grade. In evaluating your lectures, I will look at their clarity, organization and preparedness. I will also consider how your lectures improve over the course of the semester.\n\nYou will give a practice lecture to a small audience before your first lecture. This group will consisting of the course instructor, the mathematics writing instructor working with this class, and the other student lecturing in the same class as you.\n\nEach lecturer will give one or two exercises relevant to the material being presented. These exercises, and their solutions, should be e-mailed to the course instructor as a Latex file. The exercises can be stated during lecture, though this is not necessary. It's ok if the exercises come from a book (although it'd be preferable if they did not, or at least if they were slightly modified), but be sure to give proper attribution.\n\nAs a member of the audience, I'd like you to write a few comments on each lecture you observe. I'm not asking for any kind of lengthy analysis; it would be enough to point out that the lecturer is writing too small. However, make sure the comments are useful--don't just say \"that proof was good,\" say why. I will collect these comments at the end of class and e-mail them to the lecturer so that they can have some feedback. (The lecturer will not know who made which comments.)\n\nHomework\n\nThere will be approximately four problem sets. These will count towards the final grade. Solutions are to be written in Latex. You may work together on the problem sets, but everyone must write up their own solutions.\n\nThere will also be exercise sets, mainly composed of exercises given by lecturers. These are optional and do not have to be turned in. If you are interested in learning the material, it is probably a good idea to do at least some of the exercises.\n\nFinal Paper\n\nThe final paper is an exposition of a topic in algebraic topology that we will not cover in the seminar. It must be at least 10 pages long and written in Latex. Topics will be selected for the papers by session 15. A first draft is due in session 27, and a final draft two weeks later. In the final five meetings of class, students will give talks on their final papers.\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\n1-14\n\nFundamental Group, Covering Spaces\n\nProblem set 1 due in Session 9\n\n15-25\n\nHomology\n\nTopic for final paper due in Session 15; Problem set 2 due in Session 20\n\n26-34\n\nCohomology, Poincare Duality\n\nFirst draft of paper due in Session 27; Final draft of paper due is Session 32\n\n35-39\n\nStudent Presentations of their final papers\n\nProblem set 3 due in Session 38",

See the website for additional instructions.\nProblem 1. Let n ≥ 1 be an integer. Let CPn denote the set of all lines in Cn+1 passing through\nthe origin. There is a natural map π : Cn+1 \\ {0} → CPn taking a point to the line it spans. We\ngive CPn the quotient topology, so that a set U in CPn is open if and only if π-1(U) is open in\nCn+1 . Let Ui ⊂ CPn denote the set of points of the form π(x0, . . . , xn) where xi = 0.\n\n(a) Show that the Ui form an open cover of CPn .\n(b) Show that an intersection of k + 1 distinct elements of {U0, . . . , Un} is homeomorphic to\n(C×)k × Cn-k, for 0 ≤ k ≤ n. (In particular, each Ui is homeomorphic to Cn.)\n(c) Prove the following lemma. Let X be a topological space and let U be a finite open cover of\nX. Suppose that each element of U is simply connected and any intersection of elements of\nU is non-empty and path-connected. Then X is simply connected. [Hint: use van Kampen's\ntheorem.]\n(d) Conclude that CPn is simply connected.\nRemark. The space CPn is called complex projective space. It is a very important space that shows\nup in all areas of mathematics. The space CP1 is called the Riemann sphere; it is homeomorphic\nto S2 (convince yourself of this!).\nProblem 2. Let X be a topological space and let x1 and x2 be two points in X. Given a path h\nbetween x1 and x2, we have seen that there is a canonical isomorphism\nih : π1(X, x1) → π1(X, x2).\nWrite C(G) for the set of conjugacy classes in a group G, and let\nih : C(π1(X, x1)) → C(π1(X, x2))\ndenote the map induced by ih.\n(a) Give an example (i.e., specify X, x1, x2, h and hi) where ih = ih' , with proof.\n(b) Show that ih = ih' for any two paths h and hi.\n(c) Assume π1(X, x1) is abelian. Show that ih = ih' for any h and hi.\nRemark. Note the contrast between (a) and (b) -- given two choices of basepoints x1 and x2, the\nsets C(π1(X, x1)) and C(π1(X, x2)) are in canonical bijection (assuming X is path connected),\nwhile the groups π1(X, x1) and π1(X, x2) are not.\nRemark. The fact that ih and ih' are not necessarily equal is why π1 is only a functor for basepoint\npreserving maps.\nProblem 3. Let X be a metric (and thus topological) space. Fix a basepoint x0 in X; the word\n\"loop\" will mean \"loop based at x0\" in this problem. Let ΩX denote the set of all loops in X, i.e.,\nthe set of all continuous functions p : [0, 1] → X with p(0) = p(1) = x0. Define a distance function\non ΩX by d(p1, p2) = maxx∈[0,1] d(p1(x), p2(x)).\n(a) Show that concatentation of loops defines a continuous map ΩX × ΩX → ΩX. Conclude\nthat there is a natural map of sets π0(ΩX) × π0(ΩX) → π0(ΩX). [Here π0 denotes the set\nof path components.]\n(b) Show that two loops in X are homotopic if and only if the corresponding points of ΩX are\nin the same path component.\n\n(c) Construct a canonical bijection of sets π0(ΩX) → π1(X, x0). Show that this map is a\nhomorphism, in the sense that it respects the multiplications on the two sets (the one on\nπ0(ΩX) constructed in (a) and the usual group operation on π1(X, x0)).\nRemark. In fact, the bijection from (c) is just the first in a sequence: there are natural group\nisomorphisms πn-1(ΩX, x0) → πn(X, x0) for all n ≥ 1. [Here πn denotes the nth homotopy group.]\nRemark. The above theory does not at all require X to be a metric space, it just simplifies the\ndefinition of the topology on ΩX. When X is a general topological space, the appropriate topology\non ΩX is the \"compact open topology.\"\nProblem 4. In this problem, we will show that every finitely presented group occurs as a funda\nmental group.\n(a) Let G be a group, let a be an element of G and let N be the normal closure of the subgroup\ngenerated by a. [Explicitly, N is the subgroup of G generated by all conjugates of a.] Let\nZ → G be the map defined by 1 → a. Show that the amalgamated free product G ∗ Z 1 is\nisomorphic to G/N. [Here 1 denotes the trivial group.]\n(b) Let X be a topological space with base point x0 and let i : S1 → X be a loop based at x0.\nLet Xi be the topological space obtained by attaching a 2-disc to X via i; that is, Xi is the\nquotient of X I D2 where an element x ∈ S1 = ∂D2 is identified with i(x) ∈ X. Show that\nπ1(Xi, x0) is the quotient of π1(X, x0) by the normal subgroup generated by the class of i.\n[Hint: use van Kampen's theorem.]\n(c) Show that every finitely presented group occurs as a fundamental groups. [Hint: let G be a\nfinitely presented group. Pick a presentation. Start with a bouquet of circles, one for each\ngenerator. Attach a 2-disc for each relation and apply (b).]\nRemark. The requirement that the group be finitely generated is completely unnecessary. The\ngeneral case can be established by the same means.\nRemark. There can be many very different homotopy types that have isomorphic fundamental\ngroups; for instance, both S1 and S1 ∨ S2 have fundamental group Z. However, given a group G\nthere is a unique homotopy type with fundamental group G and contractible universal cover (or\nequivalently, with all other homotopy groups vanishing).\nProblem 5. Let G be a topological group; thus G is simulateneously a group and a topological\nspace, and the multiplication map G × G → G and inversion map G → G are continuous.\n(a) Show that there is a unique group structure on π0(G) such that the natural map G → π0(G)\nis a group homomorphism.\n(b) Show that π1(G, 1) is a commutative group. [Hint: if c is a loop in G based at 1 and g is\nan element of G then t → gc(t) is a loop in G based at g. Using this you can slide one loop\nalong another to show that they commute in π1.]\nProblem 6. Let G = SL(2, R), the group of 2 × 2 real matrices with determinant 1. We can natu\nrally regard G as a closed subset of R4, and thus (after a few simple verifications) as a topological\ngroup. Let B* ⊂ G be the subgroup of matrices which are upper-triangular with positive entries\non the diagonal. Let K ⊂ G be the subgroup of rotations matrices. [An element of G belongs to\nK if and only if its two columns form an orthonormal basis of R2.]\n(a) Show that B* is homeomorphic to R2, and is thus contractible.\n(b) Show that K is homeomorphic to S1 .\n(c) Show that the map B* × K → G sending (b, k) to bk is a homeomorphism.\n(d) Conclude that G is homotopy equivalent to S1, and thus has fundamental group Z.\nRemark. The group SL(2, R) is better than just a topological group: as a topological space it is\nactually a smooth manifold, and the group operations are smooth maps. Such topological groups\nare called Lie groups. They are among the most important objects in all of mathematics.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.904 Seminar in Topology\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Solutions to Problem Set 1\n18.904 Spring 2011\nProblem 1\nStatement. Let n ≥1 be an integer. Let CPn denote the set of all lines in Cn+1 passing through\nthe origin. There is a natural map π : Cn+1 \\ {0} →CPn taking a point to the line it spans. We\ngive CPn the quotient topology, so that a set U in CPn is open if and only if π-1(U) is open in\nCn+1. Let Ui ⊂CPn denote the set of points of the form π(x0, . . . , xn) where xi = 0.\n(a) Show that the U form an open cover of CPn\ni\n.\n(b) Show that an intersection of k + 1 distinct elements of {U0, . . . , Un} is homeomorphic to\n(C×)k × Cn-k, for 0 ≤k ≤n. (In particular, each Ui is homeomorphic to Cn.)\n(c) Prove the following lemma. Let X be a topological space and let U be a finite open cover of\nX. Suppose that each element of U is simply connected and any intersection of elements of\nU is non-empty and path-connected. Then X is simply connected. [Hint: use van Kampen's\ntheorem.]\n(d) Conclude that CPn is simply connected.\nSolution. (a) The set π-1(Ui) consists of those points (x0, . . . , xn) of Cn+1 with xi = 0. This is\nopen, and so Ui is open in CPn+1. Every point of CPn is of the form π(x0, . . . , xn) where at least\none of x0, . . . , xn is not zero. If xi is non-zero, then the point belongs to Ui. This shows that the\nUi cover.\n(b) The situation is symmetrical, so to ease notation we only consider the intersection U =\nU0 ∩· · · ∩Uk. Let V be the subspace of Cn+1 consisting of elements of the form (1, x1, . . . , xn)\nwhere xi = 0 for 1\ni\nk. We give V the subspace topology, with which it is clearly homeomorphic\nto (C×)k ×Cn\nk\n≤\n≤\n-. It is clear that π maps V into U. We now define a map in the opposite direction:\ni : U →V,\ni(π(x\nx1\nxn\n0, . . . , xn)) =\n1,\n, . . . ,\n.\nx0\nx0\nIt is easy to see that i is well-defined: first, if π(x) belongs\n\nto U then x0\n\n= 0 and so we can divide\nby x0, and second, if π(x) = π(y) then x = λy for some λ ∈C×, and so xi = yi for all i\nx0\ny\n. It is\nalso easy to see that π and i are mutual inverses. Indeed, if x ∈V then x0 = 1 and so i(π(x)) = x.\nSimilarly, if x ∈U then we can write x = π(y) for some y\n∈Cn+1 \\{0}. We then have i(x) = y\n-y,\nand so π(i(x)) = π(y0\n-y) = π(y) = π(x), since y0\n-y and y span the same line. It remains to show\ncontinuity of each map. The map π : V →U is continuous since it is just the restriction of the\nmap Cn+1 \\ {0} →CPn, which is continuous by definition.\nWe now show that i is continuous. Let W be an open set of V . We must show that i-1(W)\nis an open subset of U. By the definition of the topology on U, this set is open if and only if\nπ-1(i-1(W)) is an open subset of Cn+1. Now, π-1(i-1(W)) is easily seen to be C×W, i.e., it\nconsists of all non-zero multiples of elements of W. Let x be an element of W. We can then find\nan open neighborhood W of 1 in C×, such that W = W -1\n1 , and an open neighborhood W2 of x\nin W such that W1W2 ⊂W. It follows then that C×W contains W1\nk\n× W2 (where here we regard\nW2 as a subset of (C×) × Cn-k). This is an open set of Cn+1 \\ {0}, which shows that x belongs\nto the interior of C×W. Now, if x is an arbitrary element of C×W, then we can find λ ∈C× such\nthat λx ∈W. If W ′ is an open neighborhood of λx in Cn+1 \\ {0} contained in C×V , then λ-1W ′\nis such a neighborhood of x. It follows that all points of C×W belong to its interior, i.e., it is open.\n(c) [When writing this problem, I forgot that we were doing a general version of van Kampen's\ntheorem allowing for covers with more than two open sets. The following inductive proof establishes\n(c) using van Kampen's theorem for only two element covers. Part (c) is fairly trivial to derive\nfrom the general van Kampen theorem.]\n\nWe proceed by induction on the cardinality of U .\nIt is clear if #U = 1.\nNow let U =\n{U1, . . . , Un} be given. Put Y = U2∪U3∪· · ·∪Un. By the inductive hypothesis applied to Y and the\ncover {U2, . . . , Un}, we conclude that Y is simply connected. Now, U1∩Y = (U1∩U2)∪· · ·∪(U1∩Un).\nWe claim that this set is path connected. Thus let x and y be points in it. Then x belongs to\nU1 ∩Ui and y belongs to U1 ∩Uj, for some i and j. The sets U1 ∩Ui and U1 ∩Uj are non-empty,\npath-connected, contained in Y and each contain the non-empty U1 ∩Ui ∩Uj. It follows that we\ncan find a path in U1 ∩Ui from x to some point in U1 ∩Ui ∩Uj, and then a path in U1 ∩Uj from\nthis point to y. The composite path provides a path from x to y contained entirely in U1 ∩Y . This\nproves that U1 ∩Y is path connected. Now, U1 and Y are simply connected and their intersection\nis path-connected; van Kampen's theorem now shows that X = U1 ∪Y is simply connected. This\ncompletes the proof.\n(d) The open cover {U\nn\n0, . . . , Un} of CP\nsatisfies the hypotheses of the lemma from (c), and so\nCPn is simply connected.\nProblem 2\nStatement. Let X be a topological space and let x1 and x2 be two points in X. Given a path h\nbetween x1 and x2, we have seen that there is a canonical isomorphism\nih : π1(X, x1) →π1(X, x2).\nWrite C(G) for the set of conjugacy classes in a group G, and let\nih : C(π1(X, x1)) →C(π1(X, x2))\ndenote the map induced by ih.\n(a) Give an example (i.e., specify X, x1, x2, h and h′) where ih = ih′, with proof.\n(b) Show that ih = ih′ for any two paths h and h′.\n(c) Assume π1(X, x1) is abelian. Show that ih = ih′ for any h and h′.\nSolution. (a) Take X to be S1 ∨S1, take x1 = x2 to be the point where the two circles meet,\ntake h to be the trival path from x1 to itself and take h′ to be the path going around one of\nthe circles. Then ih is the identity map from π1(X, x1) to itself, while ih′ is given by conjugation\nby [h′], regarded as an element of π1(X, x1). Since the center of π1(X, x1) is trivial (we know\nthis fundamental group is the free group on two letters) and [h′] is non-trivial (it is one of the\ngenerators), conjugation by [h′] is not the identity map on π1(X, x1). Thus ih = ih′.\n(b) If g is an element of π1(X, x1) then i\nh(g) is by definition h-gh, where h-\nis the reverse\npath from x2 to x1, and juxtaposition denotes concatenation of paths. We thus have\nih′(g) = (h′)-1gh′ = (h′)-1hih(g)h-1h′ = aih(g)a-1,\nwhere a = (h′)-1h is an element of π1(X, x2). This shows that ih′(g) and ih(g) are conjugate in\nπ1(X, x2). Thus ih′ = ih.\n(c) In an abelian group, two elements are conjugate if and only if they are equal. Thus ih = ih′\nimplies ih = ih′.\nProblem 3\nStatement. Let X be a metric (and thus topological) space. Fix a basepoint x0 in X; the word\n\"loop\" will mean \"loop based at x0\" in this problem. Let ΩX denote the set of all loops in X, i.e.,\nthe set of all continuous functions p : [0, 1] →X with p(0) = p(1) = x0. Define a distance function\non ΩX by d(p1, p2) = maxx [0,1] d(p1(x), p\n∈\n2(x)).\n(a) Show that concatentation of loops defines a continuous map ΩX × ΩX →ΩX. Conclude\nthat there is a natural map of sets π0(ΩX) × π0(ΩX) →π0(ΩX). [Here π0 denotes the set\nof path components.]\n\n(b) Show that two loops in X are homotopic if and only if the corresponding points of ΩX are\nin the same path component.\n(c) Construct a canonical bijection of sets π0(ΩX) →π1(X, x0).\nShow that this map is a\nhomorphism, in the sense that it respects the multiplications on the two sets (the one on\nπ0(ΩX) constructed in (a) and the usual group operation on π1(X, x0)).\nSolution. (a) Let (p1, p2) be an element of ΩX × ΩX and let ε > 0 be given. If (p′\n1, p′\n2) is another\npoint of ΩX × ΩX such that d(p1, p′\n1) < ε and d(p2, p′\n2) < ε, then d(p1p2, p′\n1p′\n2) < ε as well; this\nis immediate from the definitions. By elementary properties of metric spaces, this implies that\nconcatenation of loops is continuous. We now have maps\nπ0(ΩX) × π0(ΩX) →π0(ΩX × ΩX) →π0(ΩX),\nwhere the first comes from basic point-set topology, and the second is the one induced from the\nconcatenation map.\n(b) Let p0 and p1 be two loops in X. Suppose first that they are homotopic. Let pt be a homotopy\nbetween them. Then t 7→pt provides a path between p0 and p1 in ΩX, provided it is continuous.\nWe now show that it is continuous. Let t ∈[0, 1] and ε > 0 be given. Since (t, x) 7→pt(x) is\ncontinuous, for each x ∈[0, 1] we can find an open rectangle Ux in [0, 1]2 containing (t, x) with\nthe property that d(pt1(x1), pt2(x2)) < ε for all (t1, x1) and (t2, x2) in Ux. By compactness of the\ninterval, we can find x1, . . . , xn such that Ux1, . . . , Uxn covers t × [0, 1]. The union of these open\nsets contains a rectangle of the form V × [0, 1], where V is an open interval containing t. Thus for\nany t′ ∈V we have d(pt, pt′) < ε. This shows that t 7→pt is continuous.\nNow suppose that p0 and p1 belong to the same path component of ΩX. Let P : [0, 1] →ΩX be a\npath connecting them, i.e., a continuous map with P(0) = p0 and P(1) = p1. Let e : [0, 1]×ΩX\n→X\nbe the evaluation map (x, p) 7→p(x). Define a map [0, 1] →X by (t, x) 7→e(x, P(t)). This is a\nhomotopy between p0 and p1, provided it is continuous. To show that it is continuous, it suffices\nto show that e is continuous.\nWe now do this. Let (x, p) ∈[0, 1] × ΩX and ε > 0 be given. Let J be an open neighborhood of\nx such that d(p(x1), p(x2)) < ε for all x1, x2 ∈J. Let U be the open ball in ΩX centered at p and\nof radius ε. If (x1, p1) belongs to J × ΩX then\nd(p(x), p1(x1)) ≤d(p(x), p(x1)) + d(p(x1), p1(x1)) ≤2ε.\nThis shows that e is continuous.\n(c) Define a map i : π0(ΩX) →π1(X, x0) as follows. Let C be a path component of ΩX and let\np be a point on C. Then i(C) is the class of p in π1(X, x0). This is well-defined by (b): if p′ is a\ndifferent point on C, then there is a path between p and p′ in ΩX and thus a homotopy between\np and p′ in X, and so p and p′ represent the same class in π1(X, x0). It is also injective by (b). It\nis obviously surjective. Furthermore, it is obviously compatible with the two product operations,\nsince they're both defined by concatenation.\nProblem 4\nStatement. In this problem, we will show that every finitely presented group occurs as a funda-\nmental group.\n(a) Let G be a group, let a be an element of G and let N be the normal closure of the subgroup\ngenerated by a. [Explicitly, N is the subgroup of G generated by all conjugates of a.] Let\nZ →G be the map defined by 1 7→a. Show that the amalgamated free product G ∗Z 1 is\nisomorphic to G/N. [Here 1 denotes the trivial group.]\n(b) Let X be a topological space with base point x\n0 and let i : S →X be a loop based at x0.\nLet X′ be the topological space obtained by attaching a 2-disc to X via i; that is, X′ is the\nquotient of X ⨿D2 where an element x ∈S1 = ∂D2 is identified with i(x) ∈X. Show that\n\nπ1(X′, x0) is the quotient of π1(X, x0) by the normal subgroup generated by the class of i.\n[Hint: use van Kampen's theorem.]\n(c) Show that every finitely presented group occurs as a fundamental groups. [Hint: let G be a\nfinitely presented group. Pick a presentation. Start with a bouquet of circles, one for each\ngenerator. Attach a 2-disc for each relation and apply (b).]\nSolution. (a) It's easiest to prove this using the universal property of amalgamated free products.\nLet H be an arbitrary group. Giving a map G ∗Z 1 →H is the same as giving a map G →H that\nkills a, and this is the same as giving a map G/N →H. This shows that G/N satisfies the same\nuniversal property as G ∗Z 1, and so the two are isomorphic.\n(b) We first remark that it suffices to treat the case where X is path-connected. Indeed, let X1\nbe the path component to which x0 belongs and let X1\n′ be constructed in an analogous manner to\nX′. We have a diagram\nπ1(X, x0)\nπ1(X′, x0)\nπ1(X1, x0)\nπ1(X1\n′, x0)\nThe diagram obviously commutes. The vertical maps are easily seen to be isomorphisms, since π1\nonly depends on the path component that the basepoint lies in. We thus see that if the bottom\nmap is surjective with kernel the normal closure of [i], then the top map has the same property.\nThus we may as well replace X by X1 and assume that X is path-connected.\nLet 0 be a chosen point on D2 not on its boundary. Let U = X′ \\ {0} and let V be the open\nunit disc, regarded as a subset of X′. Let x1 be a point in U ∩V and let h be a path from x0 to\nx1 such that h(t) ∈U ∩V for t = 0. We have a commutative diagram\nπ1(U, x1)\nπ1(X′, x1)\nπ1(U, x0)\nπ1(X′, x0)\nwhere the horizontal maps are the natural ones and the vertical ones are ih. Furthermore, the\nnatural map π1(X, x0) →π1(U, x0) is an isomorphism, since U deformation retracts onto X. It\nfollows that π1(X, x0) →π1(X′, x0) is a surjection with kernel the normal closure of the subgroup\ngenerated by [i] if and only if π1(U, x1) →π1(X′, x1) is a surjection with kernel the normal closure\nof the subgroup generated by j = ih([i]). (Sorry for the two i's!)\nNow, U and V are path-connected open sets that cover X′ and their intersection is path connected\nand contains x1. In fact, their intersection is an annulus and j generates its fundamental group.\nBy van Kampen's theorem, π1(X′, x1) = π1(U, x1) ∗Z 1, where Z is really π1(U ∩V, x1) and 1 is\nreally π1(V, x1). Since the map Z →π1(U, x1) sends 1 to j, we see from part (a) that π1(X′, x1) is\nthe quotient of π1(U, x1) by the normal subgroup generated by j. This completes the proof of (b).\n(c) Let G be a finitely generated group. Let a1, . . . , an be generators for G and let b1, . . . , bm\nbe sufficient relations to present G. Let G0 be the free group on the ai and let Gi be the quotient\nof G0 by the normal subgroup generated by b1, . . . , bi. Note that Gi is the quotient of Gi-1 by\nthe normal subgroup generated by bi and that Gm = G. We now prove inductively that there are\nspaces\nX0 →X1 →· · · →Xm\nsuch that π1(Xi) = Gi, and the map π1(Xi) →π1(Xi+1) is the natural quotient map Gi →Gi+1. To\nobtain X0, simply take a bouquet of circles, one for each ai. Assume now that we have constructed\nXi\n1. Via the map G0 →Gi\n1, we can regard bi as an element of π1(Xi\n1). By (b), we can now\n-\n-\n-\nattach a 2-disc to Xi\n1 to obtain a space X with\n-\ni\nπ1(Xi) = Gi. This completes the proof.\n/\nO\n/\nO\n\n/\nO\n/\nO\n\nProblem 5\nStatement. Let G be a topological group; thus G is simulateneously a group and a topological\nspace, and the multiplication map G × G →G and inversion map G →G are continuous.\n(a) Show that there is a unique group structure on π0(G) such that the natural map G →π0(G)\nis a group homomorphism.\n(b) Show that π1(G, 1) is a commutative group. [Hint: if c is a loop in G based at 1 and g is\nan element of G then t 7→gc(t) is a loop in G based at g. Using this you can slide one loop\nalong another to show that they commute in π1.]\nSolution.\n(a) The map G →π0(G) is surjective, so there is at most one group structure on\nπ0(G) which makes this map a homomorphism. Let G*be the path component of G containing\nthe identity element. Then G*is a normal subgroup of G. Indeed, suppose that x and y belong to\nG*. Let p be a path from 1 to x and let q by a path from 1 to y. Then t 7→xq(t) is a path from\nx to xy. Concatenating this with p, we obtain a path from 1 to xy. This shows that G*is closed\nunder multiplication. It is clear that G*is closed under inversion; t 7→p(t)-1 provides a path from\n1 to x-1. This shows that G*is a group. Finally, if y is any element of G then t 7→yp(t)y-1 is a\npath from 1 to yxy-1, and so G*is normal.\nWe now claim that two elements x and y of G belong to the same path component if and only\nif xy-1 ∈G*. First suppose that xy-1 ∈G*. Let p be a path from 1 to xy-1. Then t 7→p(t)y is\na path from x to y, and so x and y lie in the same path component. Conversely, suppose that p is\na path from x to y. Then t 7→p(t)y-1 is a path from xy-1 to 1, and so xy-1 belongs to G*. This\nestablishes the claim.\nIt follows that the natural map G →π0(G) factors as G →G/G*followed by the bijection\nG/G*→π0(G). Since G*is normal, G/G*is a group, and the bijection of this with π0(G) gives a\ngroup structure on π0(G).\n(b) Let f and g be two loops based at the identity. Let Ft be the concatenation of the following\npaths: first, the path f|[0,t], from 1 to f(t); then, the loop s 7→f(t)g(s), based at f(t); and finally,\nthe map f|[t,1] from f(t) to 1. (In the second step, the juxtaposition denotes multiplication in the\ngroup.) One easily sees that F : [0, 1]2 →G is continuous. (The function F is defined piecewise\non three regions in [0, 1]2. It is clearly continuous on each region, and there is agreement at the\nboundaries. This implies it is continuous.) Now, F(0) is the concatenation gf, while F(1) is the\nconcatenation fg. Thus fg and gf are homotopic, and so π1(X, 1) is commutative.\nProblem 6\nStatement. Let G = SL(2, R), the group of 2 × 2 real matrices with determinant 1. We can natu-\nrally regard G as a closed subset of R4, and thus (after a few simple verifications) as a topological\ngroup. Let B*⊂G be the subgroup of matrices which are upper-triangular with positive entries\non the diagonal. Let K ⊂G be the subgroup of rotations matrices. [An element of G belongs to\nK if and only if its two columns form an orthonormal basis of R2.]\n(a) Show that B*is homeomorphic to R2, and is thus contractible.\n(b) Show that K is homeomorphic to S1.\n(c) Show that the map B*× K →G sending (b, k) to bk is a homeomorphism.\n(d) Conclude that G is homotopy equivalent to S1, and thus has fundamental group Z.\nSolution. (a) The group B*consists of matrices of the form\n\na\nb\na-1\n\nwith a > 0. We thus have evident bijections between B*and R\nR\n≥0 ×\nsending a point (a, b)\nin R≥0 × R to the above matrix, and the above matrix to (a, b) in R≥0 × R. These maps are\n\neach continuous since their components are. We thus find that B*is homeomorphic to R≥0 × R.\nSince R\nis\n≥0\nhomeomorphic to R (by the logarithm and exponential maps), we find that B*is\nhomeomorphic to R2, and thus contractible.\n(b) A rotation matrix necessarily has the form\n\nx\ny\n-y\nx\n\nwith x2+y2 = 1. We thus have evident bijections between K and S1 sending a point (x, y) on S1 to\nthe above matrix, and the above matrix to the point (x, y) on S1. These maps are each continuous\nsince their components are continuous functions.\n(c) Let ⟨, ⟩be the standard inner product on R2; it is given by\n⟨x, y⟩= x1y1 + x2y2.\nLet ∥x∥2 = ⟨x, x⟩be the associated norm. Let e1, e2 be the standard basis for R2. Let g be an\nelement of G. Then ge1 and ge2 is also a basis for R2. The Graham-Schmit process allows us to\ntake this basis and obtain an orthonormal basis. Precisely, put\nge\n=\nge\n=\n( )\n=\nge1, ge2\nge1 -ge1\nf1\nA g ge1,\nf2\n-⟨\n⟩∥\n∥\n= D(g)ge + B(g)ge\n∥ge1∥\n∥ge2 -⟨\n⟩∥\n∥-\n∥\nge1, ge2\nge\nge1\n(Here A(g), B(g) and D(g) are just real numbers; for instance, A(g) = ∥ge\n1∥-.) Then f1 and f2\nform an orthonormal basis for R2. Let β(g) be defined by\nA(g)\nB(g)\nβ(g)-1 =\n\nD(g)\n\nThen fi = gβ(g)-1ei. Since κ(g) = gβ(g)-1 takes the orthonormal basis (e1, e2) to the orthonormal\nbasis (f1, f2), it follows that κ(g) belongs to K. Thus β(g) has determinant 1, and is clearly upper\ntriangular, and so belongs to B*. Since the components of β(g)-1 (i.e., A, B and D) are clearly\ncontinuous functions of G, we find that β : G →B*is continuous. Since κ is defined from β and\nmatrix multiplication, κ : G →K is continuous.\nWe have thus constructed a continuous function\nG →K × B*,\ng 7→(κ(g), β(g))\nwhich is a one-sided inverse to the (obviously) continuous function\nK × B*→G,\n(b, k) 7→bk,\ni.e., the composite G →K ×B*→G is the identity. To finish the proof, it suffices to show that the\nmap K ×B*→G is injective, for then the two maps are forced to be mutual inverses. Thus assume\nthat bk = b′k′. Then (b′)-1b = k′k-1, and so k′k-1 belongs to K ∩B*. However, K ∩B*= 1 (easy\ncalculation), and so k = k′, from which it follows that b = b′. This completes the proof.\n[I just noticed that I did things backwards! The problem asked to show that B*× K →G is a\nhomeomorphism and I showed that K × B*→G is a homeomorphism. There are two ways to fix\nthis. First, one could change the above proof, using row operations instead of column operations.\nOr, one could observe that there is a commutative diagram\nφ\nG\nG\nψ\nK × B*\nB*× K\nwhere the vertical maps are multiplication maps, φ(g) = g-1 and ψ(k, b) = (b-1, k-1). Since φ, ψ\nand the left map are homeomorphisms, it follows that the right map is as well.]\n/\nO\n/\nO\n\n(d) From (a)-(c), we find that G is homeomorphic to R2 × S1, and thus homotopy equivalent to\nS1. Thus π1(G) = Z.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.904 Seminar in Topology\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Problem Set 2\n18.904 Spring 2011\nInstructions. Same as last time. Due: Friday, March 18.\nProblem 1. Let Sn be the n-sphere and fix a base point 1 ∈ Sn . For a pointed topological space\n(X, x0) let πn(X, x0) denote the set of homotopy classes of maps (Sn , 1) → (X, x0).\n(a) Suppose X is contractible. Prove that πn(X, x0) is a one point set, for any n.\n(b) Suppose p : ( X, xX0) → (X, x0) is a covering space. Show that p∗ : πn( X, xX0) → πn(X, x0) is\na bijection for n ≥ 2. [Here p∗ is defined by p∗(f) = [p * f]; a standard argument shows this\nis well-defined.]\n(c) Let T be a torus (i.e., (S1)d) and t0 ∈ T a basepoint. Prove that πn(T, t0) is a one point set\nfor n ≥ 2. [Hint: what is the universal cover of T ?] This is not at all visually obvious!\nRemark. The set π0(X, x0) is in fact the set of path components of X (convince yourself of this!). This set\nhas no extra structure, such as that of a group. Of course, we know that π1(X, x0) is a group, and can\nbe any group. For n ≥ 2, the sets πn(X, x0) are in fact abelian groups in a natural way. These are the\nhigher homotopy groups. Part (b) above says that the higher homotopy groups don't change when passing\nto covers, in constrast to the fundamental group.\nProblem 2. As is well-known, there's no way to define a continuous square root function on the\nentire complex plane. More generally, one cannot always find a square root of a complex valued\nfunction on a given topological space. We'll show how covering spaces can be used to solve this\nproblem. (In what follows, \"function\" means \"continuous function.\")\n(a) Let X be a topological space and let f : X → C be a function which is never equal to 0.\nShow that there exists a natural degree two covering space p : X\n→ X such that p ∗f has a\nsquare root, i.e., there exists a function fX: X\n→ C such that fX(x)2 = f(p(x)).\n(b) Show that f has a square root if and only if p : X\n→ X is a trivial covering space, i.e.,\nisomorphic to the covering space X I X → X.\n(c) Establish analogues of (a) and (b) with logarithms taking the place of square roots.\nRemark. Notice that if X is simply connected then any non-vanishing complex valued function on X has a\nsquare root and logarithm, since any covering space is then trivial.\nProblem 3. Let C be a category and let A1 and A2 be two objects of C. A triple (B, p1, p2)\nconsisting of an object B of C and morphisms p1 : B → A1 and p2 : B → A2 is called a product of\nA1 and A2 if it satisfies the following condition: given any triple (T, f1, f2) consisting of an object\nT and morphisms f1 : T → A1 and f2 : T → A2, there exists a unique map f : T → B such that\nf1 = p1 * f and f2 = p2 * f. We say that \"C has products\" if for every A1 and A2 there is a product\n(B, p1, p2).\n;\n;\n(a) Suppose that (B, p1, p2) and (B;, p1, p ) are two products of A1 and A2. Show that there\n;\n;\nexists a unique isomorphism i : B → B; such that p1 = p1 * i and p2 = p2 * i.\n(b) For each category C in the following list, say whether C has products or not. If it has\nproducts, describe the product of two general objects (proof not required). If not, give\nan example of two specific objects which do not have a product (with a reason, but not\nnecessarily a formal proof).\n(i) The category of topological spaces.\n(ii) The category of pointed topological spaces.\n(iii) The category of groups.\n(iv) The category of covering spaces of a fixed space X.\n(v) The category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are bijections of sets.\n\nAs with most notions in category theoy, the notion of a product has a dual notion, that of a\n\"coproduct,\" obtained by reversing all the arrows in the definition. Precisely, a coproduct of A1\nand A2 is a triple (C, i1, i2) consisting of an object C and morphisms i1 : A1 → C and i2 : A2 → C,\nwith a universal property similar to that of the product.\n(c) Carry out part (b) with coproducts in place of products.\nRemark. Due to part (a), products are essentially unique, and there is no harm in speaking of \"the\" product\nof two objects A1 and A2 (when it exists). This is usually denoted A1 × A2. Similar remarks apply to the\ncoproduct; the typical notation is A1 I A2. One of the wonders of category theory is that, after defining a\ncategory, all these things like product and coproduct come \"for free\" -- you don't need to give new definitions\nfor each category.\nProblem 4. In this problem, we'll examine covering spaces of topological groups.\n(a) Let G be a path-connected topological group and let p : GX → G be a covering map with\nGX path-connected. Let X1 be an element of GX mapping to 1 under p. Show that there is a\nunique group law on GX such that X1 is the identity, p is a homomorphism and multiplication\nand inversion are continuous. [Hint: use path lifting!]\n(b) Let G = SL(2, R). In the last problem set, we saw that π1(G, 1) = Z. By the Galois\ncorrespondence, we therefore have a unique connected degree two covering space GX → G\n(up to isomorphism), and by (a) we have a canonical group structure on GX after choosing\nX1. Give a description of GX, as a topological group. [Hint: look up \"metaplectic group\" on\nWikipedia.]\nPart (b) is really hard, don't feel bad if you cannot get it (but do try)!\nProblem 5. Let X be a topological space such that every point has a neighborhood basis of\ncontractible open sets. We'll show how the groups π1(X, x), for x varying, can be put together to\nform a covering space of X. The construction is similar to the that of the universal cover.\nLet Π(X) denote the set of all homotopy classes of loops in X, i.e., the set of all classes [γ] where\nγ : I → X satisfies γ(0) = γ(1). Given [γ] ∈ Π(X) and a contractible open neighborhood U of\nγ(0), let U[γ] consist of all loops of the form [ηγη-1] where η is a path in U with η(1) = γ(0). We\ntopologize Π(X) by taking the U[γ]'s to be a basis. Let p : Π(X) → X be defined by [γ] → γ(0).\n(a) Show that p is a covering space map.\n(b) Construct a canonical bijection fx : π1(X, x) → p-1(x) for any x ∈ X.\n(c) Let h be a path in X from x to y. Let ih : π1(X, x) → π1(X, y) be the usual isomorphism.\nDefine a map i; : π1(X, x) → π1(X, y) as follows. Given [γ] ∈ π1(X, x), regard [γ] as an\nh\nelement of p-1(x) via the isomorphism fx. Let Xh : I → Π(X) be a lift of h with Xh(0) = [γ].\nDefine i; ([γ]) to be Xh(1) ∈ p-1(x1), regarded as an element of π1(X, x1) via f-1 . Show that\nh\ny\nih\nh.\n= i;\n(d) Show that Π(X) is path-connected if and only if X is simply connected.\n(e) Suppose that X is path-connected and let x0 ∈ X be a basepoint. Let q : X ×π1(X, x0) → X\nbe the trivial covering map, given by q(x, [γ]) = x. Show that (Π1(X), p) is isomorphic to\n(X × π1(X, x0), q) as covering spaces if and only if π1(X, x0) is abelian. [Hint: use the\nresult from the first problem set that ih = ih' for any two paths h and h; if π1(X, x0) is\nabelian. You may also use its converse, without proof. It may also be useful to consider the\ncategorical form of the Galois correspondence.]\nRemark. The covering space Π(X) is in some ways more natural than the fundamental group, since it does\nnot depend on a base point. There is a natural multiplication map Π(X) ×X Π(X) → Π(X), where ×X\ndenotes the product in the category of covering spaces of X, which gives each fiber p-1(x) a group law in\nsuch a way that each fx is an isomorphism of groups. The covering space Π(X) is closely related to the\n\"fundamental groupoid.\"\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.904 Seminar in Topology\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Problem Set 2 Solutions\n18.904 Spring 2011\nI don't have time at the moment to write up a complete solution set to this problem set. Everyone\nseemed to have most of the general ideas down, and most of the mistakes were technical. However,\nthere is one general fact -- the categorical form of the Galois correspondence -- that clarifies many\nof the problems, and that no one employed. Perhaps we didn't cover this well enough or completely\nenough, but hopefully the solutions that follow will show you how to work with it.\n1. Review of the Galois correspondence in categorical form\nLet G be a group. Recall that a G-set is a set S together with an action of G on S. If S and S′\nare two G-sets then a map f : S →S′ is simply a map of sets which commutes with the G-action,\ni.e., f(gx) = gf(x) for all g ∈G and x ∈X. In this way, we have a category of G-sets.\nNow let X be a path-connected topological space (with whatever other technical hypotheses are\nneeded, e.g., locally path connected). Let x0 be a point in X. Suppose that p : Y →X is a covering\nspace. We claim that the fiber p-1(x0) naturally has an action of the group π1(X, x0). To see this,\nsuppose that y is a point in the fiber and γ is a loop in X based at x0. By the unique lifting property,\nthere is a unique path γ in Y beginning at y which lifts γ. We define γ · y to be the endpoint of the\npath γe. Since γ is a loop, its endpoint is x0; thus the endpoint of γ is something which maps to x0\nunder p, i.e., an elemen\ne\nt of the fiber p-1(x0). Thus (after verifying details that this is well-defined\nand satisfies the necessary conditions), we have an action of π1(X, x0) on p-1(x0).\nNow suppose that p′ : Y ′ →X is another covering space and w\ne\ne have a map of covering spaces\nf : Y →Y ′. Recall that this means that f is a continuous map such that p′ *f = p. Due to this\ncondition, f maps the set p-1(x ) into (p′)-1\n(x0). One easily checks that this map commutes with\nthe action of π1(X, x0) on each set.\nThe above discussion shows that associating to a covering space Y →X its fiber p-1(x0) defines\na functor\n{covering spaces of X} →{π1(X, x0)-sets}.\n(Here we use the set notation to indicate a category.) The categorical form of the Galois correspon-\ndence states that this functor is an equivalence of categories. Thus, any purely categorical notion\nabout covering spaces can be determined by considering the category of π1(X, x0) sets.\n2. Problem 2\nThe categorical Galois correspondence can be used to give an elegant proof of 2(b), as follows.\nFirst, we introduce a term: if p : Y →X is a covering space, a section is a map of covering spaces\ns : X →Y , where X is regarded as the trivial covering space of itself. In other words, a section is\na map s : X →Y such that p *s = idX. It is clear in 2(b) that giving a square root of f is the\nsame as giving a section of Xe →X, for if we have a section s then we simply pull back f by s to\nget a square root, while if we have a square root f then defining s(x) = (x, f(x)) gives a section\n(where here we think of Xe as a subspace of X × C, as all of you did).\ne\nThus 2(b) is reduced to the following: if X →X\ne\nhas a section then X is isomorphic\ne\nto X ⨿X\nas a covering space. However, this is obvious from the Galois correspondence. We know that X\ncorresponds to a 2 element set S with some\ne\naction of π1(X, x0), while X\ne\ncorresponds to a 1 point\nset S0 with the trivial action of π1(X, x0). A section of X defines an inclusion S0 →S, which shows\ne\nthat one of the two elements of S is fixed under π1(X, x0). But since there are only two elements,\nthe other one must be fixed as well. Thus S is isomorphic\ne\nto S0 ⨿S0 as a π1(X, x0)-set, which\nshows that Xe is isomorphic to X ⨿X as a covering space.\n\nThis proof is perhaps not shorter than some of the ones that you all came up with, but I think its\neasier since you don't have to think about lifting paths. The same method does not apply verbatim\nto 2(c), but you can make it work. Exercise!\n3. Problem 3\nThe categorical Galois correspondence is the easiest way to handle parts (iv) of 3(b) and 3(c).\n(At least if we assume X is path-connected, which the problem didn't, but which you can easily\nreduce to.) Since these questions are about the structure of the category of covering spaces, they\ncan be answered by passing to an equivalent category, i.e., the category of π1(X, x0) sets. In this\ncontext, the answer is clear: the category of G-sets has products and coproducts for any group G.\nThe product of two G-sets S1 and S2 is the cartesian product S1 × S2 of sets, with the diagonal\nG-action, i.e., g(x, y) = (gx, gy). The coproduct of S1 and S2 is the disjoint union S1 ⨿S2 with G\nacting on each in the given manner.\nUnderstanding what these operations are in terms of covering spaces is not difficult, and a useful\nexercise. I'll tell you the answers but not why they're the answers. Suppose p1 : Y1 →X and\np2 : Y2 →X are two covering spaces. Then their coproduct is just the disjoint union of Y1 and Y2,\nwith the obvious map down to X. Their product (in the category of covering spaces) is the fiber\nproduct of Y1 and Y2. This is denoted Y1 ×X Y2 and is defined as the set of points (y1, y2) in Y1 ×Y2\nsuch that p1(y1) = p2(y2), with the subspace topology. Thus it is the union of the products of the\nfibers, which is why it is so named. (These descriptions of product and coproduct are valid even if\nX is not path-connected.)\nMany of you tried to use the (non-categorical) Galois correspondence to do this problem. That's\nthe right direction to think in, but doesn't work for two reaons: first, this bijection applies only to\npointed coverings; and second (and more importantly), it applies only to connected coverings. It\nis clear from the previous paragraph that the coproduct of covering spaces gives a non-connected\ncover. It's a worthwhile exercise for you to see how the product of connected covering spaces can\nend up being non-connected. For instance, if Y is a non-trivial covering space of X then its self-\nproduct Y ×X Y is always disconnected (hint: find a map of covering spaces from Y to Y ×X Y\nand use this to see that π1(X, x0) does not act transitively on the fiber of Y ×X Y ).\n4. Problem 5\nIn this problem the use of the categorical form of the Galois correspondence makes the solution\nvery elegant and provides much greater understanding of what's going on, at least for parts (d)\nand (e). Fix a point x0 in X. By part (a) we have that Π(X) is a covering space of X. By\npart (b) we know its fiber over x0 can be identified with π1(X, x0). This gives us the set that\nΠ(X) corresponds to under the categorical form of the correspondence. But what is the action of\nπ1(X, x0) on this set? The answer is provided in (c): π (X, x ) acts on the fiber p-1\n(x0) = π1(X, x0)\nby conjugation. (The definition of this action is given by i′\nh, and (c) shows that it equals ih, which\nis just conjugation by h.) We thus see that Π(X) corresponds to the π1(X, x0)-set π1(X, x0), with\naction being conjugation.\nParts (d) and (e) are now very easy, when combined with some further properties of the Galois\ncorrespondence. Let's do (d) first. A covering space of X is path-connected if and only if the\ncorresponding π1(X, x0)-set is transitive. The action of π1(X, x0) on itself by conjugation fixes\nthe identity element, and therefore is transitive if and only if π1(X, x0) = 1. Thus Π(X) is path-\nconnected if and only if X is simply connected.\nNow for part (e). A covering space of X is trivial if and only if the corresponding π1(X, x0)-set\nis trivial, i.e., every point is fixed by the action of π1(X, x0). The action of π1(X, x0) on itself by\nconjugation fixes all elements if and only if π1(X, x0) is abelian -- that is the definition of abelian!\nThis completes (e).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.904 Seminar in Topology\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Let T = S1 ×S1 be the two dimensional torus and let T / be the complement\nin T of a small disc. Let X be the space obtained by taking two copies of T / and connecting them\nby a cylinder meeting the boundaries of the removed discs. Compute Hi(X) for all i and describe\nthe cup product H1(X) × H1(X) → H2(X).\nProblem 2 (5 points). Let X be the topological space with four points a, b, x and y such that {x}\nand {y} are closed, while the closure of {a} is {a, x, y} and the closure of {b} is {b, x, y}. Compute\nHi(X) for all i ≥ 0.\nRemark. I believe it is true, generally, that for every compact CW complex X one can construct a\nfinite topological space X/ and a map X → X/ such that the induced map Hi(X) → Hi(X/) is an\nisomorphism. Thus finite spaces with non-Hausdorff topologies should not be ignored!\nProblem 3 (5 points). Let G be the cyclic group of order 3. Construct a topological space X on\nwhich G acts such that H2(X) is isomorphic to Z2 and the induced action of G is non-trivial.\nProblem 4 (15 points). Let c be a generator for H1(S1) ∼\nFor two topological spaces X and\n= Z.\nY , write [X, Y ] for the set of homotopy classes of maps between X and Y . Given a topological\nspace X, we have a natural map\nΦX : [X, S1] → H1(X),\nf → f ∗(c).\nObserve that Φ is a natural transformation of functors, that is, if X → Y is a map then there is a\ncommutative diagram\nH1(Y )\n- H1(X)\n\nΦY\nΦX\n[Y, S1]\n- [X, S1]\nThis will be a useful observation in what follows.\nThe purpose of this problem is to show that ΦX is an isomorphism whenever X is a CW complex\nwith finitely many cells. We'll break the proof into many steps.\n(a) Show that ΦX is an isomorphism if X is a one dimensional CW complex.\nWe now do some basic obstruction theory. Let me remind you of a simple fact: a map ∂Dn → X\nextends to Dn if and only if it is null-homotopic.\n(b) Let f and g be maps Dn → S1, with n ≥ 2, and let H be a homotopy between f|∂Dn and\ng|∂Dn . Show that H can be extended to a homotopy between f and g. [Hint: Interpret H\nas a map from a sphere and extend it to a disc!]\n(c) Let X be a topological space and let Y be obtained from X be attaching a single n-cell.\nShow that the natural map [Y, S1] → [X, S1] is injective if n ≥ 2.\n(d) Notation as in (c), show that [Y, S1] → [X, S1] is surjective if n ≥ 3.\nFor the next few steps, let X be a finite two dimensional CW complex and let Y be obtained from\nX be attaching a single 2-cell. Let i : S1 → X be the attaching map. We regard X as a subspace\nof Y .\n(e) Show that there is an exact sequence\n0 → H1(Y ) → H1(X) i∗\n→ H1(S1).\n\n(f) Let f : X → S1 be a given map. Show that f extends to Y if and only if f∗(c) belongs to\nH1(Y ). [Hint: Use part (e) to characterize H1(Y ) as a subset of H1(X) and the fact that\na map h : S1 → S1 is null-homotopic if and only if h∗(c) = 0.]\n(g) Suppose that ΦX is bijective. Show that ΦY is as well.\nBy part (f) and an easy induction argument, we find that ΦX is an isomorphism for all finite two\ndimensional CW complexes X. We now complete the argument. Let X be a finite CW complex\nand let Y be obtained from X be attaching a single n-cell, with n > 2.\n(h) Show that the natural map H1(Y ) → H1(X) is an isomorphism.\n(i) Suppose that ΦX is bijective. Show that ΦY is as well.\nWe now find that ΦX is bijective for all finite CW complexes X by induction!\nRemark. In fact, it is true that for any n ≥ 0 there is a CW complex Kn such that [X, Kn] = Hn(X)\nholds for CW complexes X. The above problem proves this for n = 1 and shows K1 = S1 . (At least\nwhen X is finite.) It is very easy to see that K0 = Z. It is much less easy to see that K2 = CPinf .\nFor n > 2, I do not know a nice description of Kn.\nProblem 5 (10 points). Let C be a category and let Set be the category of sets. There is a\ncategory F = Fun(Cop, Set) whose objects are functors Cop → Set and whose morphisms are\nnatural transformations of functors. (Recall that Cop is the opposite category to C, and that a\nfunctor Cop → Set is the same thing as a contravariant functor C → Set.)\n(a) Let X be an object of C. Show that hX (T ) = HomC (T, X) defines a functor hX : Cop → Set.\n(b) Show that X → hX defines a functor h : C →F.\n(c) Show that the functor h above is fully faithful, i.e., the natural map HomC(X, Y ) →\nHomF (hX , hY ) is a bijection.\n(d) In particular, show that if hX is isomorphic to hY in the category F then X is isomorphic\nto Y in the category C.\nRemark. The above result (specifically part (c)) is known as Yoneda's lemma. It can be very\nconfusing when you first see it, but it is essentially tautological! Yoneda's lemma is an extremely\nuseful organizational device: it says that an object in a category is fully determined by how other\nobjects of the category map to it.\nRemark. Let F : C → Set be a functor. We say that an object X of C represents F if F is\nisomorphic to hX . Such an object is unique up to isomorphism by Yoneda's lemma, but need not\nexist. In this language, Problem 4 is just the statement that S1 represents the functor H1 (on the\ncategory of finite CW complex with homotopy classes of maps). Yoneda's lemma tells us that this\nproperty uniquely characterizes S1: if another finite CW complex represents H1 then it must be\nhomotopy equivalent to S1 .\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.904 Seminar in Topology\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

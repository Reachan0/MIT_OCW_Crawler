      "content": "An Introduction to The Twin Prime Conjecture\nAllison Berke\nDecember 12, 2006\nAbstract\nTwin primes are primes of the form (p, p + 2). There are many proofs\nfor the infinitude of prime numbers, but it is very difficult to prove whether\nthere are an infinite number of pairs of twin primes. Most mathemati\ncians agree that the evidence points toward this conclusion, but numerous\nattempts at a proof have been falsified by subsequent review. The prob\nlem itself, one of the most famous open problems in mathematics, has\nyielded a number of related results, including Brun's conjecture, Mertens'\ntheorems, and the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture. Along with these con\njectures, there are a number of results which are easier to arrive at, but\nnevertheless help mathematicians think about the infinitude of primes,\nand the special properties of twin primes. This paper will introduce the\naforementioned conjectures associated with the twin prime conjecture, and\nwork through some exercises that illuminate the difficulties and intricacies\nof the twin prime conjecture.\nIntroduction: The Original Conjecture and\nFailed Proofs\nThe term twin prime was coined by Paul Stackel in the late nineteenth cen\ntury. Since that time, mathematicians have been interested in the properties of\nrelated primes, both in relation to number theory as a whole, and as specific,\nwell-defined problems. One of the first results of looking at twin primes was\nthe discovery that, aside from (3, 5), all twin primes are of the form 6n ± 1.\nThis comes from noticing that any prime greater than 3 must be of the form\n6n ± 1. To show this, note that any integer can be written as 6x + y, where\nx is any integer, and y is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Now consider each y value individ\nually. When y = 0, 6x + y = 6x and is divisible by 6. When y = 1 there\nare no immediately recognizable factors, so this is a candidate for primacy.\nWhen y = 2, 6x + 2 = 2 (3x + 1), and so is not prime. For the case when\n·\ny = 3 : 6x + 3 = 3 (2x + 1) and is not prime. When y = 4 : 6x + 4 = 2 (3x + 2)\n·\n·\nand is not prime. When y = 5, 6x + 5 has no immediately recognizable factors,\nand is the second candidate for primacy. Then all primes can be represented as\neither 6n + 1 or 6n - 1, and twin primes, since they are separated by two, will\nhave to be 6n - 1 and 6n + 1.\n\nQ\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nFurther research into the conjecture has been concerned with finding expres\nsions for a form of the prime counting function π(x) that depend on the twin\nprime constant. The prime counting function is defined as\nπ(x) = {N(p)|p 5 x}\nwhere N(p) denotes the number of primes, p. One motivation for defining the\nprime counting function is that it can be used to determine a formula for the\nsize of the intervals between primes, as well as giving us an indication of the\nrate of decay by which primes thin out in higher numbers. It has been shown\nalgebraically that the prime counting function increases asymptotically with\nthe logarithmic integral [12]. In the following expression, π2(x) refers to the\nnumber of primes of the form p and p + 2 greater than x, and\nis the twin\nQ\nprime constant, which is defined by the expression\n(1 - 9p-\n1)2 ) over primes\np = 2. The term O(x), meaning \"on the order of x,\" is defined as follows: if\nf(x) and g(x) are two functions defined on the same set, then f(x) is O(g(x))\nas x goes to infinity if and only if there exists some x0 and some M such that\n|f(x)| 5 M|g(x)| for x greater than x0. This expression for the twin prime\ncounting function is\nπ2(x) 5 cΠ2\nx\n[1 + O(ln(ln(x)))]\n(1)\n(ln(x))2\nln(x)\nwhich is the best that has been proven thus far. The constant c in (1) has been\nreduced to 6.8325, down from previous values as high as 9 [12]. The formation\nof this inequality involves two of Merten's theorems which will be discussed in\nthe following section. Hardy and Littlewood [3] have conjectured that c = 2,\nand using this assumption have formulated what is now called the Strong Twin\nPrime Conjecture. In the following expression, a ∼ b means that a approaches 1\nb\nat the limits of the expressions a and b. In this case, the limit is as x approaches\ninfinity.\nZ x\ndx\nπ2(x) ∼ 2Π2\n(ln(x))2 .\n(2)\nA necessary condition for the strong conjecture (2) is that the prime gaps con\nstant, Δ ≡ lim supn→inf\npn+1-pn be equal to zero. The most recent attempted\npn\nproof of the twin prime conjecture was that of Arenstorf, in 2004 [1], but an\nerror was found shortly after its publication, and it was withdrawn, leaving the\nconjecture open to this day.\nMertens' Theorems\nA number of important results about the spacing of prime numbers were derived\nby Franz Mertens, a German mathematician of the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century. The following proofs of Mertens' conjectures lead up to the\nresult that the sum of the reciprocals of primes diverges, which will contrast\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nX\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nwith Brun's conjecture, that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes con\nverges. First, we should briefly show that the primes are infinite, for otherwise\nthe implications of Mertens' theorems are not obvious. Euclid's proof of this\npostulate, his second theorem, is as follows.\nLet 2, 3, 5, ..., p be an enumeration of all prime numbers up to p, and let\nq = (2 3 5 · ... p) + 1. Then q is not divisible by any of the primes up\n·\n·\n·\nto and including p. Therefore, it is either prime or divisible by a prime between\np and q. In the first case, q is a prime greater than p. In the second case, the\ndivisor of q between p and q is a prime greater than p. Then for any prime p,\nthis construction gives us a prime greater than p. Thus, the number of primes\nmust be infinite [4]. Now we can resume with Mertens' theorems.\nMertens Theorem 1:\nFor any real number x ≥ 1,\nX\nx\n0 ≤\nln( n ) < x.\n(3)\nn≤x\nProof:\nThe function f(t) = ln( x\nt ) is decreasing on the interval [1, x], so\nx\nX\nx\nZ\nx\nln( ) < ln(x) +\nln( )dt\n1≤n≤x\nn\nt\nWe can rewrite the right-hand side of the inequality as the following:\nx\nx\nx\nln(x) +\nln( )dt = x ln(x) -\nln(t)dt.\nt\nSimilarly, we can rewrite this:\nx\nx ln(x) -\nln(t)dt = x ln(x) - (x ln(x) - x + 1) < x.\nFor Mertens' second theorem, we introduce the Von Mangoldt's function, Λ(n),\nwhere\nm\nΛ(n) = ln(p) if n = p\nis a prime power, and zero otherwise.\nThen the psi function of the prime number theorem is defined as follows\nΨ(x) =\nΛ(m).\n1≤m≤x\n\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nMertens Theorem 2:\nFor any real number x ≥ 1,\nX Λ(n) = ln(x) + O(1).\n(4)\nn\nn≤x\nProof:\nLet N = [x]. Then\nN\nX\nx\nX\n0 ≤\nln( ) = N ln(x) -\nln(n) = x ln(x) - ln(N!) + O(ln(x)) < x\nn\nn≤x\nn=1\nln(N!) = x ln(x) + O(x).\nThe proof of this equation, which is integral to the theorem, is shown on the\nnext page. Let vp(n) denote the highest power of p, a prime, that divides n.\nThen\nX\nln(N!) =\nvp(N) ln(p)\np≤N\nWe can rewrite this as a single summation, by combining the limits on p and k:\n[ ln(N )\nln(p) ]\nX X N\nln(N!) =\n[ pk ] ln(p).\np≤N\nk=1\nFor ease of notation, we replace N with x, and substitute Von Mangoldt's\nfunction:\nX x\nln(x!) =\n[ ]Λ(n).\nn\nn≤x\nNow we can remove the floor function brackets by introducing an error term\non the order of one, since the maximum error obtained by removing the floor\nfunction is less than one:\nX x\nln(x!) =\n(\n+ O(1))Λ(n).\nn\nn≤x\nWe can distribute this term, forming two sums, one in the error term:\nX Λ(n)\nX\nln(x!) = x\n+ O(\nΛ(n)).\nn\nn≤x\nn≤x\nNow we can substitute in the Psi function defined earlier:\nX Λ(n)\nln(x!) = x\n+ O(Ψ(x)).\nn\nn≤x\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nSince the Psi function is of the same order as a linear function in x, we can\nreplace it in the error term, obtaining the following:\nX Λ(n)\nln(x!) = x\n+ O(x).\nn\nn≤x\nTherefore,\nX Λ(n)\nx\n+ O(x) = x ln(x) + O(x)\nn\nn≤x\nX Λ(n) = ln(x) + O(1)\nn\nn≤x\nMertens Theorem 3:\nFor any real number x ≥ 1,\nX ln(p) = ln(x) + O(1).\n(5)\np\np≤x\nProof:\nFrom the previous theorem,\n0 ≤\nX Λ(\nn\nn) -\nX ln(\np\np)\nX\nln(\npk\np)\n=\nn≤x\np≤x\npk ≤x,k≥2\ninf\na\nln(p)\n≤\nln(p)\npk ≤\np(p - 1)\np≤x\nk=2\np≤x\n≤ 2\nln(\np2\np) ≤ 2\ninfln(\nn2\nn) = O(1)\np≤x\nn=1\nIt then follows from the previous theorem that\nX ln(p) =\nX Λ(n) + O(1) = ln(x) + O(1).\np\nn\np≤x\nn≤x\nFinally, the last and longest of Mertens' theorems presented here brings us to\nour desired conclusion.\nMertens Theorem 4:\nThere exists a constant b1 > 0 such that\nX 1\np = ln(ln(x)) + b1 + O(ln(x)), x ≥ 2.\n(6)\np≤x\n\nR\nZ\nP\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nProof:\nWe can write\nX 1 =\nX ln(p)\n=\nX\nu(n)f(n)\np\np ln(p)\np≤x\np≤x\nn≤x\nwhere u(n) = ln(\np\np) if n = p, and 0 otherwise, and f(t) = ln(\nt) . We define new\nfunctions U(t) and g(t) as follows\nX\nX ln(p)\nU(t) =\nu(n) =\n= ln(t) + g(t)\np\nn≤t\np≤t\nThen U(t) = 0 for t < 2 and g(t) = O(1) by the previous theorem. Then the\ng(t)\nintegral 2\ninf\n(t ln(t)2) dt converges absolutely, and\ninf g(t)dt\n= O(\n).\nt(ln(t))2\nln(x)\nx\nWe know that f(t) is continuous and U(t) is increasing, so we can express\n1 as a Riemann integral. U(t) = 0 for t < 2, so by partial sums,\np≤x p\nNathanson [8] shows the conclusion of this theorem:\nX 1\nX\nx\n=\nu(n)f(n) =\n+\nf(t)dU(t)\np\np≤x\nn≤x\nIntegrating by parts, we obtain the following:\nx\nx\nln(x) + g(x)\nx\n2 +\nf(t)dU(t) = f(x)U(x) -\nU(t)df(t) =\nln(x)\n-\nU(t)f 0(t)dt.\nNow we can simplify the term outside the integral, and substitute in for U(t):\nx\nx ln(t) + g(t)\n+\nf(t)dU(t) = 1 + O(\n) +\ndt.\nln(x)\nt(ln(t))2\nWe can split the integral in order to simplify the result:\nx\nx\ninf\ng(t)\ninf\ng(t)\n2+\nf(t)dU(t) =\n2 t ln(t) dt+\nt(ln(t))2 dt-\nx\nt(ln(t))2 dt+1+O(ln(x)).\nNow we can evaluate two of the integrals:\nx\ninf\ng(t)\nt ln(t) dt +\nt(ln(t))2 dt = ln(ln(x)) - ln(ln(2))\nFinally, we can simplify this result in terms of a variable b1:\nln(ln(x))-ln(ln(2))+\ninf\ng(t)\ndt+1+O( 1 ) = ln(ln(x))+b1 +O(\n)\nt(ln(t))2\nln(x)\nln(x)\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nwhere\nZ\nb1 = 1 - ln(ln(2)) +\ninf\ng(t)\ndt.\nt(ln(t))2\nNow thanks to Mertens, we not only know that the sum of reciprocals of primes\ndiverges, we can see that it diverges like the function ln(ln(x)).\nBrun's Conjecture\nAn important step towards proving the twin prime conjecture is the realization,\nfirst made by Brun in 1919, that the sum of the reciprocals of odd twin primes\nconverges to a definite number. While this fact does not limit the number of\ntwin primes, it shows that they are distributed infrequently among the real\nnumbers.\nBrun's Conjecture:\nLet p1, p2, ... be the sequence of prime numbers p such that p + 2 is also prime.\nThen\ninf\n( pn\n+ pn + 2 ) = ( 3 + 5) + ( 5 + 7) + ( 11 + 13) + . . . < inf\n(7)\nn=1\nProof:\nThe proof of the theorem depends on a result which will be shown in the exercises\nand assumed here, namely that π2(x) <<\nx\n2 for all x ≥ 2. Then\n(ln(x))\npn\npn\nn = π2(pn) <\n≤\n(ln(pn))\n(ln(n))\nfor n ≥ 2. Then\n<\npn\nn(ln(n))\n2 .\nIt follows that the series defined above is convergent:\ninf\ninf\ninf\n≤ 3 +\npn\n<< 3 +\n2 .\nn=2 n(ln(n))\npn\nn=1\nn=2\nThen we have a stronger bound for π2(x) than the one discussed earlier: we\nx\ncan now write that π2(x) = O( ln(ln(x)) ), as shown in Nathanson [8] The exact\nconstant to which Brun's series converges is unknown, but its value has been\ncalculated to be approximately 1.9021605824 [5]. The constant's value gives an\nidea of how infrequent twin primes actually are. Had Brun's series diverged,\nit would have indicated immediately that there are an infinite number of twin\nprimes. The fact that the series converges does not allow one to reach a con\nclusion about the infinitude of twin primes, but it makes the problem more\ndifficult.\n\nZ\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nThe Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture\nThe first Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture, also known as the k - tuple conjecture,\nstates that the number of prime constellations can be computed. A prime\nconstellation is a sequence of primes p1, p2, ..., pn where the difference between\nthe first and last primes, pn - p1, is s. This s is the smallest number such\nthat there exist n integers in an interval of length s, and, for every prime q, at\nleast one of the residues pi (mod q) is not one of these n integers. Hardy and\nLittlewood have then conjectured that\nx\ndt\nπ2(x) ∼ 2Π2\nln(t)2\n(8)\nHere Π2 refers to the twin prime constant introduced before, which is\nΠ2 =\nY p\n(p\n(p\n-\n-\n1)\n2)\n2 ≈ 0.6601618158468695739278121100145 . . . [12]\np>3\nThe formulation of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture builds upon some of the\ntechniques used to prove Brun's conjecture, namely the Brun sieve techniques.\nThe Brun sieve can be constructed as follows: Let X be a nonempty, finite set\nof N objects, and let P1, . . . , Pr be r different properties that the elements of\nthe set X might have. Let N0 denote the number of elements of X that have\nnone of these properties. For any subset I = {i1, . . . , ik} of {1, 2, . . . , r}, let\nN(1) = N(i1, . . . , ik) denote the number of elements of X that have each of the\nproperties Pi1 , Pi2 , . . . , Pik . Let N(∅) = |X| = N . If m is a nonnegative even\ninteger, then\nm\nN0 ≤\n(-1)k\nN(I).\n(9)\nk=0\n|I|=k\nIf m is a nonnegative odd integer, then\nm\nN0 ≥\n(-1)k\nN(I).[8]\n(10)\nk=0\n|I|=k\nThe proof given in Nathanson [8] is as follows. Let x be an element of the set\nX, and suppose that x has exactly l properties Pi. If l = 0, then x is counted\nonce in N0 and once in N(∅), but is not counted in N(I) if I is nonempty. If\nl ≥ 1, then x is not counted in N0. By renumbering the properties, we can\nassume that x has the properties P1, P2, . . . , Pl. Let I ⊆{1, 2, . . . , l, . . . , r}. If\ni ∈ I for some i > l, then x is not counted in N(I). If I ⊆{1, 2, . . . , l} then\nx contributes 1 to N(I). For each k = 0, 1, . . . , l, there are exactly\nk\nl\nsuch\nsubsets with |I| = k. If m ≥ l, then the element x contributes\nX\nl\nl\n(-1)k\n= 0\nk\nk=0\n\nTwin Prime Conjecture\nto the right sides of the inequalities. If m < l, then x contributes\nm\n\nX\nl\n(-1)k\nk\nk=0\nto the right sides of the inequalities. This contribution is positive if l is even\nand negative if l is odd.\nThe Hardy-Littlewood conjecture makes use of this sieve by considering a set\nof primes with properties corresponding to the size of the intervals between\nconsecutive members. Then the Brun sieve is used to make generalizations\nabout these properties based on the primes themselves.\nThe Hardy-Littlewood conjecture is compatible with the twin prime conjecture\nas originally stated, and is in fact sometimes substituted in as the strong twin\nprime conjecture, because it is understood that its proof would involve the\nintegral going to infinity, and therefore π2 going to infinity as well.\nExercises\nAn interesting exercise involving the distribution of primes is determining the\nnumber of primes in an interval. To formulate a corresponding expression, we\ncan start out by rewriting π(x + x) - π(x) in terms of Euler's approximation.\nThen\nx + x\nx\nx\nπ(x + x) - π(x) = ln(x) + ln(1 + ) - ln(x) + O(ln(x)).\nWe can rewrite the right-hand side as\nx\nx\n+ O(\n)\nln(x)\nln(x)\nThen if we let = 1,\nx\nx\nπ(2x) - π(x) = ln(x) + O(ln(x))\nWhere O( ln(\nx\nx) ) ∼ π(x). At first, it appears that this is saying that the number\nof primes in an interval is equal to the number of primes in a sequential interval\nof equal length, which is misleading, because we know from experience and\ncomputation that the primes thin out as we progress through the numbers.\nHowever, a better formulation of the result of this exercise would be that\nπ(2x) - 2π(x) = O(π(x))\nand this result is not inconsistent with known tables of primes.\nEarlier, we used a result discovered by the German mathematician Brun, which\nwe can prove here.

In addition to its series expansion, it\ncan also be written as an infinite product. The infinite product of\nsin x can be used to prove certain values of ζ(s), such as ζ(2) and\nζ(4). The gamma function is related directly to the sin x function\nand can be used to prove the infinite product expansion. Also used\nare Weierstrass' product formula and Legendre's relation.\n1. Introduction\nThere are a few special functions in mathematics that have particular\nsignificance and many applications. The gamma function is one of\nthose functions. The gamma function can be defined as\ninf\nΓ(x) =\ne-ttx-1dt.\nWe can also get the formula\n(1)\nΓ(x + 1) = xΓ(x)\nby replacing x with x + 1 and integrating by parts.\nIn addition, since Γ(1) = 1, using Equation (1), by induction, we can\nrelate the gamma function to the factorial formula\n(2)\nΓ(n) = (n - 1)!.\nThe gamma function has the properties that it is log convex and mono\ntonic, which will be used in a later proof.\nAnother important function in mathematics is the sine function.

To derive\nthe infinite product expansion of the sine function, the Weierstrass\nproduct formula, Legendre relation, and the gamma function are all\nused.\nThe sine product formula is important in mathematics because it has\nmany applications, including the proofs of other problems.

Weierstrass' product formula\nWeierstrass derived a formula which, when applied to the gamma\nfunction, can be used to prove the sine product formula. To find Weier\nstrass' product formula, we first begin with a theorem.\nTheorem 2.1. The function Γ(x) is equal to the limit as n goes to\ninfinity of\nnxn!\n(3)\nΓ(x) = lim\n.\nn→inf x(x + 1)\n(x + n)\n· · ·\nProof. Begin with a difference quotient expressed as the inequality\nlog Γ(-1 + n) - log Γ(n)\nlog Γ(x + n) - log Γ(n)\nlog Γ(1 + n) - log Γ(n) .\n(-1 + n) - n\n≤\n(x + n) - n\n≤\n(1 + n) - n\nThis inequality is true because of the gamma functions properties that\nit is monotonically increasing and log convex. Substitute for Γ(n) using\nEquation (2) and simplify to get\nlog(n - 1) ≤ log Γ(x + n) - log(n - 1)! ≤ log n.\nx\n\nX\nTHE SINE PRODUCT FORMULA AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\nRearrange the terms of the inequality and since the logarithm is a\nmonotonically increasing function, we get\n(n - 1)x(n - 1)! ≤ Γ(x + n) ≤ n x(n - 1)!.\nUsing Equation (1), we know that Γ(x + n) = (x + n - 1)(x + n -\n2)\n(x + 1)xΓ(x). Substituting it into the inequality gives us\n· · ·\n(n - 1)x(n - 1)!\nnxn!\nx + n.\n(x + n - 1) ≤ Γ(x) ≤\nx(x + 1)\nx(x + 1)\n(x + n)\nn\n· · ·\n· · ·\nIf we replace n with n + 1 on the left hand side and then rearrange the\ninequality, we get\nn\nnxn!\nΓ(x) x + n ≤ x(x + 1)\n(x + n) ≤ Γ(x).\n· · ·\nTaking the limit as n →inf gives us\nnxn!\nΓ(x) = lim\n.\nn→inf x(x + 1)\n(x + n)\n· · ·\nEquation (3) was derived by Gauss.

Where θ is a number inde\npendent of other values and where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. Stirling's formulas are\napproximations of Γ(x) for large values of x and the accuracy increases\nas x increases.\nGauss discovered a formula, which expresses Γ(x) as a product of its\nfactors.

They\nare based on finding an approximation for Γ(x) in terms of an estimate\nfor n!.\n4. The Sine and and Gamma Functions\nTo derive the sine product formula, we first find a relationship be\ntween the sine and gamma functions. We define a function φ(x) and\nfind that φ(x + 1) = φ(x).\nTheorem 4.1. Define the function φ(x), for nonintegral x, to be\n(7)\nφ(x) = Γ(x)Γ(1 - x) sin πx,\nthen φ(x + 1) = φ(x).\nProof. If we use Equation (1) and substitute -x + 1 for x, then we get\nthat\n(8)\nΓ(-x + 1) = -xΓ(-x).\nFinding φ(x + 1), we get\nφ(x + 1) = Γ(x + 1)Γ(-x) sin(π(x + 1)).\nNote that sin(πx+π) = - sin πx. Use Equation (1), rearrange Equation\n(8), and substitute them in to get\nφ(x + 1) = xΓ(x)Γ(-x + 1) (- sin πx) = Γ(x)Γ(-x + 1) sin πx.\n-x\nThis is equal to the original equation for φ(x), so φ(x+1) = φ(x).\n\nTHE SINE PRODUCT FORMULA AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\nThe Legendre relation (Equation (6)) can be written as\nx\nx + 1\nΓ( )Γ(\n) = b2-xΓ(x),\nwhere b = 2√π is a constant. Replacing x with 1 - x gives\nx\nΓ(1 - x )Γ(1 - ) = b2x-1Γ(1 - x).\nFrom there, we get that\nφ( x )φ( x + 1 ) = Γ( x )Γ(1 - x ) sin πx Γ( x + 1 )Γ(1 - x ) cos πx .\nSimplifying the above, we find\nx\nx + 1\nb2\nb2\nφ( )φ(\n) =\nΓ(x)Γ(1 - x) sin πx =\nφ(x) = cφ(x)\nwhere c = b2 is a constant.\nUsing Equation (1) and the infinite series expansion of sin x, we get\nthat\n(πx)3\n(πx)5\n(πx)7\nΓ(1 + x)\nφ(x) =\nΓ(1 - x) πx -\nx\n+\n+ ...\n-\n3!\n5!\n7!\nπ3x2\nπ5x4\nπ7x6\n= Γ(1 + x)Γ(1 - x) π - 3! + 5! - 7! + ... .\nThe right hand side of the equation equals π when x = 0. From there\nwe see that φ(0) = π. Let g(x) be a periodic function that is equal\nthe second derivative of log φ(x). It is periodic because log φ(x) =\nlog(Γ(x)Γ(1 - x) sin πx) is periodic and so the second derivative will\nalso be periodic. Since g(x) is periodic, then it satisfies the equation\nx\nx + 1\n(9)\ng(x) = (g( ) + g(\n)).\nSince g(x) is continuous on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, it is bounded by a\nconstant M, |g(x)| ≤ M. Because g(x) is periodic, it is bounded by M\nfor all x. From Equation (9), we get that\n)\nM\nFrom this we see that g(x) can actually be bounded by 2 . We can\ncontinue to repeat this process until the bound of g(x) goes to 0. There\nfore g(x) = 0, which means that log φ(x) is a linear function, because\ng(x) = 0 is its second derivative. Since log φ(x) is periodic, this implies\nx + 1\nM\nx\ng(x)\ng( )\ng(\n+\n|\n| ≤\n.\n≤ 2\n\nX\nERICA CHAN\nthat it is a constant, which also implies that φ(x) is constant. We know\nthat φ(0) = π and therefore φ(x) must equal π for all x.\nRearranging Equation (7) and using the fact that φ(x) = π,\nπ\nΓ(x)Γ(1 - x) =\n.\nsin πx\nUsing (1), the above equation can be rewritten as\nπ\nsin πx =\n.\n-xΓ(x)Γ(-x)\nThe Weierstrass product formula allows us to replace the gamma func\ntion and rewrite sin πx as an infinite product expansion\nY\ninf\nx\n(10)\nsin πx = πx\n1 - i2\n.\ni=1\n5. Applications of the Sine Product Formula\nApplications of the sine product formula include the calculation of\ncertain values of the Riemann zeta function.

Generating functions have useful applications in many fields of study. In this paper,\nthe generating functions will be introduced and their applications in combinatorial problems,\nrecurrence equations, and physics will be illustrated.\n1. Introduction.\nWorking with a continuous function is sometimes much easier than working with a\nsequence. For example, in the analysis of functions, calculus is very useful. However, the\ndiscrete nature of sequences prevents us from using calculus on sequences. A generating\nfunction is a continuous function associated with a given sequence. For this reason,\ngenerating functions are very useful in analyzing discrete problems involving sequences\nof numbers or sequences of functions.\nDefinition 1-1. The generating function of a sequence {fn}inf\nis defined as\nn=0\ninf\nf(x) =\nfnx n ,\n(1-1)\nn=0\nfor x < R, and R is the radius of convergence of the series.\n| |\nIt is important that the series has a nonzero radius of convergence, otherwise f(x)\nwould be undefined for all x = 0. Fortunately, for most sequences that we would be\ndealing with, the radius of convergence is positive. However, we can certainly construct\nsequences for which the series (1-1) is divergent for all x = 0; fn = nn is one such\nexample.\nExample 1-2. As a simple example of a generating function, consider a geometric\nsequence, fn = an . Then\ninf\nX\nf(x) =\na n x n =\n.\n(1-2)\nax\nn=0\n1 -\nThis series convergences absolutely whenever ax < 1. Therefore, the radius of conver\n|\n|\ngence is R = 1/ a .\n| |\nFor the rest of the paper, if not mentioned otherwise, x is always chosen to be small\nenough such that any series encountered in our analysis converges absolutely. Now we\nshall discuss an application of generating functions to linear recurrence problems.\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n18.104 Term Paper\n2. From Recursion to Algebra.\nGenerating functions can be used to solve a linear recurrence problem.\nDefinition 2-1. The problem of linear recurrence is to find the values of a sequence\n{un} satisfying\nm\nckun+k = v,\nfor some constant v and any integer n ≥0,\n(2-1)\nk=0\ngiven the initial values u0, u1, . . . , um-1, where both c0 and cm are nonzero.\nIn order to solve this recurrence problem, we use the following property of generating\nfunctions.\nProposition 2-2. If {un}inf\nis a sequence with a generating function u(x) and k\nn=0\nis a positive integer, then\ninf\n\nk-1\n\nX\nX\nun+kx n =\nu(x) -\nujxj .\n(2-2)\nxk\nn=0\nj=0\nProof: We start from the definition of u(x).\ninf\nk-1\ninf\nu(x) =\nujxj =\nujxj +\nujxj .\n(2-3)\nj=0\nj=0\nj=k\nShifting the summation index in the second term to n = j -k, we obtain\nk-1\ninf\nu(x) =\nujxj +\nun+kx n+k ,\n(2-4)\nj=0\nn=0\nfrom which Eq. (2-2) immediately follows.\n\nBy multiplying both sides of Eq. (2-1) by xn and summing from n = 0 to inf, we find\nm\ninf\ninf\nX\nX\nX\nv\nck\nun+kx n = v\nx n =\n.\n(2-5)\nx\nk=0\nn=0\nn=0\n1 -\nUsing Proposition2-2, each term on the left hand side with fixed k can be expressed in\nterms of u(x) and known constants u0, u1, . . . , um-1. We have now reduced Eq. (2-5)\ninto an algebraic equation for u(x), which can be easily solved.\nAfter finding u(x), we write down the Taylor series expansion of u(x) around x = 0.\nBecause the Taylor series of a function is unique (if it exists), the coefficient of xn in\nthe Taylor series must be un. To illustrate this method, we shall use it on the following\nexample from physics.\nExample 2-3. In special relativity, the usual one dimensional velocity addition for\n′\nmula v = u + v is modified into [1, p. 127]\nu + v\n′ v =\n,\n(2-6)\n1 + uv\n′\nwith v , u, and v measured in units of the speed of light c. We will use this velocity\naddition in the following problem. Suppose there are infinitely many cars labeled by\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nGenerating Functions and Their Applications\nintegers n ≥0. The (n + 1)-th car moves to the right relative to the n-th car with a\nrelative velocity v (0 < v < 1). In our reference frame, we denote the velocity of the\nn-th car by un. Assuming u0 = 0, find un for all n ≥1.\nSolution: Notice that un+1 is the addition of un and v using the addition formula\nin Eq. (2-6).\nun + v\nun+1 =\n,\nfor n ≥0.\n(2-7)\n1 + unv\nThis recurrence is not linear, and therefore we may not apply our previous method\ndirectly.

Special relativity predicts that any massive object always travels\nslower than light [4, p. 119].\n\n3. Applications to Combinatorial Problems.\nMany combinatorial problems can be solved with the aid of generating functions. In\nparticular, let's consider the problem of finding the number of partitions of a natural\nnumber.\nDefinition 3-1. [6, p. 169] A partition of a natural number n is a way to write n as\na sum of natural numbers, without regard to the ordering of the numbers.\nExample 3-2. 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 is a partition of 6.\nWith this definition, the generating function of the number of partitions of n has a\nsimple form.\nTheorem 3-3. [6, p. 169] If pn is the number of partitions of n and p0 = 1, then\ninf\ninf\nX\nY\npnx n =\n.\n(3-1)\nn=0\nk=1 1 -xk\nProof: First we need to establish the convergence of the infinite product for x = 0.\ninf\n\nThis infinite product converges absolutely if the series\nxk converges absolutely [3, p.\nk=1\n53]. Thus, the right hand side converges absolutely for x < 1.\n| |\nEach factor in the infinite product can be expressed as a geometric series.\ninf\ninf inf\n\nmk\n=\nx\n.\n(3-2)\nk=1 1 -xk\nk=1 m=0\nIn this form, we can see that the coefficient of the xn term is equal to the number of\ninf\nways to choose integers {mk mk ≥0, k = positive integers} satisfying n =\nmkk. If\n|\nk=1\nn\nwe take the xmk k term from the k-th factor, then we obtain x . By comparing this with\nDefinition 3-1, we conclude that the coefficient of xn is equal to the number of partitions\nof n.\n\nAs a check, let's try expanding the right hand side of Eq. (3-1) up to x4 .\ninf\npnx n = (1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + x 4)(1 + x 2 + x 4)(1 + x 3)(1 + x 4) + · · ·\nn=0\n= (1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + x 4)(1 + x 2 + x 3 + 2x 4) + · · ·\n= 1 + x + 2x 2 + 3x 3 + 5x 4 + O(x 5),\np1 = 1,\np2 = 2,\np3 = 3,\np4 = 5.\n(3-3)\nWe can easily verify that Eq. (3-3) correctly gives the number of partitions of 1 to 4.\nAnother important combinatorial problem that can be easily solved with generating\nfunctions is Catalan's problem [6, p. 260].\n\nX\nX\nX X\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX X\nX X\nGenerating Functions and Their Applications\nExample 3-4 (Catalan's Problem). Given a product of n letters, how many ways can\nwe calculate the product by multiplying two factors at a time, keeping the order fixed?\nAs an example, for n = 3, there are two ways: (a1a2)a3 and a1(a2a3).\nSolution: Denote the solution for n = m by Km. It is clear that K2 = 1. For later\nconvenience, we define K1 = 1. Now consider the n = m + 1 case. Suppose at the\nlast step of the multiplication, we have bc, where b = a1\naj, c = aj+1\nam+1, and\n· · ·\n· · ·\n1 ≤j ≤m. Notice that there are Kj ways to multiply the factors in b, and there are\nKm-j+1 ways to multiply the factors in c. Thus, for a given j, there are KjKm-j+1\nways to multiply a1\nam+1. The total number of ways can be obtained by summing\n· · ·\nover all possible values of j.\nm\nKm+1 =\nKjKm-j+1,\nm ≥1.\n(3-4)\nj=1\nMultiply both sides by xm+1 and sum from m = 1 to m = inf.\ninf\ninf\nm\nKm+1x m+1 =\nKjKm-j+1x m+1 .\n(3-5)\nm=1\nm=1 j=1\nAs usual, we define the generating function for {Kn}inf\nn=1.\ninf\nK(x) =\nKnx n .\n(3-6)\nn=1\nThe left hand side of Eq.

A wide variety of examples are discussed in [5, Chapter\n3].\n4. Legendre Polynomials.\nSo far, we have only discussed generating functions of sequences of numbers. However,\nin Section 1, I mentioned that generating function methods can also be used to analyze\nsequences of functions. One interesting example is the generating function of Legendre\npolynomials. As we shall see, the generating function provides a physical insight, with\na deep connection to electromagnetism.\nThere are several ways to define the Legendre polynomials Pn(t).\nFor example,\nthey can be defined as solutions to a differential equation [2, p. 96]. For our purposes,\nhowever, it is more convenient to define Pn(t) as follows.\ninf\nDefinition 4-1. The Legendre polynomials {Pn(t)}n=0 are defined in the interval\n-1 ≤t ≤1. [2, p. 100] They satisfy the recurrence relation\n(n + 1)Pn+1(t) = (2n + 1)tPn(t) -nPn-1(t)\nfor n ≥1,\n(4-1)\nwith P0(t) = 1 and P1(t) = t.\nFrom this definition, it is easy to prove by induction that Pn(t) is a polynomial in t\nof degree n. We now want to find the generating function of Pn(t). In order to avoid\nconfusion in the notation, we denote the generating function of Pn(t) for fixed t as\ninf\nQt(x) =\nPn(t)x n .\n(4-2)\nn=0\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\np\nGenerating Functions and Their Applications\nTaking the derivative gives\ninf\nxQ ′\nt(x) =\nnPn(t)x n .\n(4-3)\nn=1\nLet's multiply Eq. (4-1) by xn+1 and sum from n = 1 to n = inf.\ninf\ninf\n(n + 1)Pn+1(t)x n+1 =\n(2n + 1)tPn(t) -nPn-1(t) x n+1\nn=1\nn=1\ninf\ninf\ninf\nmPm(t)x m = 2tx\nnPn(t)x n + x 2\n\ntPk+1(t)x k -(k + 1)Pk(t)x k\n.\n(4-4)\nm=2\nn=1\nk=0\nThe last step follows from the substitutions m = n + 1 and k = n -1.\nWe note from Eqs. (4-2) and (4-3) that\ninf\nmPm(t)x m = xQ ′ (x) -P1(t)x = xQ ′ (x) -tx,\n(4-5)\nt\nt\nm=2\ninf\n(k + 1)Pk(t)x k = xQ ′\nt(x) + Qt(x),\n(4-6)\nk=0\nwhile Proposition2-2 implies\ninf\nx\nPk+1(t)x k = Qt(x) -P0(t) = Qt(x) -1.\n(4-7)\nk=0\nThus, Eq. (4-4) simplifies to\nxQ ′\nt(x) -tx = 2tx2Q ′\nt(x) + tx\n\nQt(x) -1\n\n-x 2\nxQ ′\nt(x) + Qt(x)\n\n,\nQ ′ (x) =\nx -t\nQt(x).\n(4-8)\nt\n-1 -2tx + x2\nBy integrating Eq. (4-8) and imposing the initial condition Qt(0) = P0(t) = 1, we obtain\ninf\nX\nQt(x) =\nPn(t)x n =\n.\n(4-9)\n√\n1 -2tx + x2\nn=0\nTo find the radius of convergence of the power series of Qt(x), we need to find the\nlocation zs (in complex plane) of the singularity nearest to the origin. Qt(zs) is singular\nif\n1 -2tzs + z 2 = 0,\n(4-10)\ns\nzs = t ± i\n1 -t2 ,\n|zs| = 1.\n(4-11)\nTherefore, Q(z) is analytic in the region z < 1, and its power series converges absolutely\n| |\nin this region.\nIn electrostatics, the potential along the z axis due to an azimuthally symmetric\nvolume charge distribution ρ(r, θ) is given by [2, p. 35] (we set 4πoo = 1)\nZ inf\nZ π\n′ 2\nρ(r ′ , θ′ )\nV (z) = 2π\ndr ′ r\ndθ ′ sin θ ′ p\n.\n(4-12)\nz2 -2zr ′ cos θ′ + r ′ 2\n\nZ\nX\nX\n18.104 Term Paper\nIf ρ(r ′ , θ′ ) is bounded, ρ(r ′ , θ′ ) = 0 for r ′ > a, and we are only interested in V (z) for\nz > a, then\nZ a\n′ 2 Z π\nr\nρ(r ′ , θ ′ )\nV (z) = 2π\ndr ′\ndθ ′ sin θ ′\n,\n(4-13)\nz\n√\n1 -2x cos θ′ + x2\nwhere x = r ′ /z < 1.\nNow we may use Eq. (4-9) with t = cos θ′ because |cos θ′ | ≤1. Eq. (4-13) can then\nbe written as\ninf\nX\nqn\nV (z) =\nzn+1 ,\n(4-14)\nn=0\nwith\nZ a\nZ π\nqn = 2π\ndr ′ (r ′ )n+2\ndθ ′ sin θ ′ ρ(r ′ , θ ′ )Pn(cos θ ′ )\nqn =\nd3 r ′ r ′ nρ(r ′ , θ ′ )Pn(cos θ ′ ).\n(4-15)\nThe numbers qn are called the multipole moments. In particular, q0 is the monopole\nmoment (or total charge), and q1 is the dipole moment [2, p. 146]. Since the n-th moment\nterm in the potential falls off as 1/zn+1, the first nonzero moment qn characterizes the\nbehavior of V (z) as z/a →inf.\nWe can see that the generating function of Pn(t) appears naturally in electromag\nnetism. This technique of expanding the potential as a series of \"moments\" is very\nuseful, and is called \"multipole expansion\".\nAn important property of Pn(t) can be shown directly from the generating function\nby considering Qt(-x).\ninf\nX\nQt(-x) =\nPn(t)(-x)n = √\n1 + 2tx + x2 .\n(4-16)\nn=0\nNotice that the right hand side is also equivalent to Q-t(x).\ninf\ninf\n(-1)nPn(t)x n =\nPn(-t)x n .\n(4-17)\nn=0\nn=0\nFrom the uniqueness of the power series of Qt(-x), we obtain Pn(-t) = (-1)nPn(t).\nTherefore Pn(t) is an odd (even) polynomial if and only if n is odd (even).\nAnother property can be obtained by setting t = 1 in Eq. (4-9).\ninf\ninf\nX\nX\nPn(1)x n =\n=\n=\nx n .\n(4-18)\nx2\nx\n√\n1 -2x +\n1 -\nn=0\nn=0\nThus, Pn(1) = 1 for all n. Since Pn(t) is odd for odd n, we also obtain Pn(-1) = (-1)n .\n5. Useful Trick to Find a Generating Function.\nIn Section 2, we saw that we can easily find the generating function of a sequence if\nthat sequence is defined through a linear recurrence. However, in some cases, we may\nnot have a linear recurrence, such as in the Catalan's problem in Section 3. For some\nsequences without a linear recurrence, it is possible to obtain the generating function\nusing a convolution property. In fact, we have actually used this property to solve the\nCatalan's problem.\n\nX\nX\nX\nX X\nX\n\nGenerating Functions and Their Applications\nDefinition 5-1.

Let {un}inf\nand {vn}inf\nbe two sequences with generating func\nn=0\nn=0\ntions u(x) and v(x) respectively. If wn = (u ∗v)n and w(x) is the generating function\nof {wn}inf , then\nn=0\nw(x) = u(x)v(x).\n(5-2)\nThe radius of convergence of w(x) is the minimum of the radii of convergence of u(x)\nand v(x).\nProof: Let r > 0 and s > 0 be the radii of convergence of u(x) and v(x). Denote\nt = min(r, s). Consider the product\ninf\ninf\nu(x)v(x) =\nuix i\nvjxj ,\n(5-3)\ni=0\nj=0\nfor x < t. Since both series converge absolutely, we may rearrange the terms in the\n| |\ndouble summation. Suppose we want to group the same powers of x. We can do this by\nwriting j = n -i, with n ≥0. For each n, i goes from 0 to n, because j is nonnegative.\ninf\nn\ninf\nu(x)v(x) =\nuix i vn-ix n-i =\nwnx n .\n(5-4)\nn=0 i=0\nn=0\nThis is precisely the definition of w(x), and the series on the right hand side converges\nabsolutely for x < t.\n\n| |\nAs we shall see later in this section, it is sometimes more convenient to find a\ngenerating function for {an/n!} instead of {an}. This is the motivation to define the\nexponential generating function.\nDefinition 5-3.

Let {fn}inf\nand {gn}inf\nbe two sequences with exponential gener\nn=0\nn=0\nating functions F(x) and G(x) respectively. If\nn\nX\nn\nhn =\nfkgn-k,\n(5-8)\nk\nk=0\nand H(x) is the exponential generating function of {hn}inf , then\nn=0\nH(x) = F(x)G(x).\n(5-9)\nThe radius of convergence of H(x) is the minimum of the radii of convergence of F(x)\nand G(x).\nProof: The proof follows the same steps as the proof of Theorem 5-2, by substituting\nun = fn/n! and vn = gn/n!.\n\nWe shall now discuss an example to illustrate the convolution method in a problem\nwhere the exponential generating function is a more convenient choice.\nExample 5-6. (Bell numbers) [6, p. 167]. Denote by bn the number of ways to write\na set of n distinct elements as a union of disjoint subsets, with b0 = 1. For n = 2, there\nare two ways: {a1, a2}, and {a1} ∪{a2}. Find a formula for bn.\nSolution: First we need to find a recurrence relation for bn. Consider a set A of\n(n + 1) distinct elements, A = {a1, a2, . . . , an+1}. Suppose a1 is contained in the first\nsubset along with j other elements, where 0 ≤j ≤n. There are\nn\nways to form this\nj\nsubset, which is the number of ways to pick j elements from {a2, a3, · · · , an+1}. Once\nthe first subset is fixed, we are left with a set S containing (n -j) distinct elements.\nThere are bn-j ways of partitioning S into subsets, and therefore we may write\nn\nn\nX\nn\nX\nn\nbn+1 =\nbn-j =\nbk,\n(5-10)\nj\nk\nj=0\nk=0\nn\nn\ninf\nby using k = n -j and\nk\n=\nn-k .

One way to find b2 is to sum the infinite series in\nEq. (5-18). However, there is a simpler way if we notice that\ninf\nX\nn-2\nx\nB ′′ (x) =\nn(n -1)bn\n,\n(5-19)\nn!\nn=2\nand thus b2 = B′′ (0).

      "content": "AVERAGE VALUES OF ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS\nROSE WONG\nAbstract. In this paper, we will present problems involving av\nerage values of arithmetic functions. The arithmetic functions we\ndiscuss are: (1)the number of representations of natural numbers\nas a sum of two squares and (2)as a sum of three squares, (3)the\nnumber of decompositions of natural numbers into sums of con\nsecutive primes, (4)the number of primitive pythagorean triangles\nwith a hypotenuse of a given length, and (5)the number of divisors\nof natural numbers.\n1. Introduction\nAn arithmetic function is defined to be a function f(n), defined for\nn ∈N, which maps to a complex number such that f: N\nC. Exam\n→\nples of arithmetic functions include: the number of primes less than a\ngiven number n, the number of divisors of n, and the number of ways\nn can be represented as a sum of two squares. While the behavior of\nvalues of arithmetic functions are hard to predict, it is easier to analyze\nthe behavior of the averages of arithmetic functions which we define\nas:\nf(1) + ... + f(n)\nlim\n= L\nn→inf\nn\nwhere L the average value of f(n). In this paper, we will examine\naverages of several different arithmetic functions.\n2. Average number of representations of a natural\nnumber as a sum of two squares\nLet r(n) be the number of representations of n as a sum of two\nsquares\nn = x + y .\nTheorem 2.1. The average number of representations of a natural\nnumber as a sum of two squares is π. That is,\nDate: November 30, 2006.\n\nROSE WONG\nr(1) + r(2) + ... + r(n)\nlim\n= π.\nn→inf\nn\nProof. For a fixed n, let\nR(n) = r(1) + ... + r(n)\nWe interpret r(n) to be the number of lattice points (points with\ninteger coordinates) on the circle x2 + y2 = n. R(n) is the number of\nlattice points in the disc x2 + y2\nn except for the origin.\n≤\nIf we place a unit square (centered on the lattice point with sides\nparallel to the coordinate axes) on each lattice point covered by the\ndisk, the total area of these squares is 1+R(n), because R(n) does not\ninclude the origin.\nThis is not exactly the area of the disk, as some squares go beyond\nthe disk's boundary and some areas of the circle are not covered by\nany square. However, we can find a circle that circumscribes all the\nsquares and a circle that is inscribed by all the squares. These will be\nthe bounding outer and inner circles, respectively.\nThe radius of the outer circle is √n + √\n2 , because the greatest dis\ntance from the origin (0,0) to an outermost lattice point is √n and the\ngreatest distance from that lattice point to the edge of its corresponding\nunit square is √1\n2 .\nHence, the area of the outter circle is larger than the area of the\nsquares.\n1 + R(n) < π(√n + √1\n2)2 .\nBy a similar argument, the area of the inner circle is less than the\narea of the squares.\n1 + R(n) > π(√n -√1\n2)2\nWe can simplify the inequalities using the fact that π\n√\n2 < 5 and\n0 < π\n2 -1 < √n (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). Therefore,\nR(n) < π(√n + √1\n)2 -1 = πn + π\n√\n2√n + π\n2 -1 < πn + 6√n\nand\n)2\nR(n) > π(√n -√1\n-1 = πn -π\n√\n2√n + π\n2 -1 > πn -6√n.\nIt follows that\nπn -6√n < R(n) < πn + 6√n,\n\nq\nAVERAGE VALUES OF ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS\nwhich is the same as\n|R(n) -πn| < 6√n.\nIf we divide by n, we get\nR(n)\n|\nn\n-π| < √n.\nTaking the limit as n →inf, we have R(n)/n\nπ and the proof is\n→\ncomplete.\n3. Average Number of Representations of a Natural\nNumber as a sum of three squares\nWe will now extend the previous problem, that is, we will find the\naverage number of representations of a natural number as a sum of\nthree squares. Again, we will use geometry with integer lattice points\nto approach this problem.\nLet f(n) denote the number of integral solutions of\nx + y + z = n.\nTheorem 3.1. The average number of representations of a natural\nnumber as a sum of three squares is 4\n3 π.\nf(1) + f(2) + ... + f(n)\nlim\n=\nπ\nn→inf\nn3/2\nProof. For a fixed n, let\nF(n) = f(1) + ... + f(n).\nWe interpret f(n) to be the number of lattice points on the sphere\nx2 + y2 + z2 = n, so F(n) to be the number of lattice points in the\nsphere x2 + y2 + z2\nn except for the origin. If we place a unit cube\n≤\non each lattice point covered in the sphere, the total volume of these\ncubes is 1 + F(n).\nWe want to find a sphere that encloses all of the cubes and a sphere\nthat is inscribed inside the cubes. The radius of the outer sphere is\n√n +\n√\n3 . Since the greatest distance between outermost lattice point\nand the edge of its corresponding cube is\n( 1\n2 )2 + ( 1\n2 )2 + ( 1\n2 )2 =\n√\n3 .\nSimilarly, the radius of the inner sphere is √n -\n√\n3 .\nComparing the volumes, we have\n)3\n1 + R(n) < 4 π(√n +\n√\n\nROSE WONG\nand\n1 + R(n) > 4 π(√n -\n√\n3)3 .\nExpanding the inequalities out, we have\nR(n) < (4 πn3/2 + 3π√n -1) + (2\n√\n3πn +\n√\n3 π)\nand\nR(n) > (4 πn3/2 + 3π√n -1) -(2\n√\n3πn +\n√\n3 π).\nUsing the fact that 2\n√\n3π < 11 and\n√\n3 π < 3, we have\n|R(n) -3\n4 πn3/2 -3π√n + 1)| < 11n -3.\nDividing by n3/2 gives\nR(n)\n3π\n| n3/2 -3 π - n + n3/2 )| < √n -n3/2 .\nTaking the limit as n →inf, we have R(n)\n4 π and the proof is\nn3/2 → 3\ncomplete.\n4. Average value of number of decompositions of a\nnatural number n into a sum of consecutive primes\nLet f(n) be the number of decompositions of a natural number n\ninto a sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers. For example,\nf(395) = 2 because\n395 = 127 + 131 + 137 = 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89.\nTheorem 4.1. The average number of decompositions of a natural\nnumber into a sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers is log 2.\n[1]\nf(1) + ... + f(n)\nlim\n= log 2\nn→inf\nn\nProof. Let P be a sequence of consecutive primes: p1 < p2 < p3 < ...\nEvery set of consecutive primes whose sum is less than or equal to x\ncontributes 1 to the sum f(1)+f(2)+... +f(n). The number of sets of\nr primes that satisfy the condition is at most π( x\nr ) and at least π( x\nr )-r.\nTherefore, we have\nk\nk\nX\nx\nX\nx\n(π( ) -r) ≤f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(x) ≤\n(π( )),\nr\nr\nr=1\nr=1\n\nr\np\n\nAVERAGE VALUES OF ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS\nwhere k is determined by\np1 + p2 + ... + pk ≤x < p1 + p2 + ... + pk+1\nUsing the above inequality and pr ≍r log r we get\nx\nk ≍\nlog x\nThis implies that Pk\nr = O(x). If we can show that Pk\n(π( x)) ∼\nr=1\nr=1\nr\nx log 2, it will follow that f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(x) ∼x log 2\nUsing the above relationship and the prime number theorem, we have\nk\nk\nZ k\nX\nx\nX\nx\nx\nr=1\n(π( r )) ∼\nr=1\n( r log x/r) ∼\n1 r log x/r dr = [-x log(log x/r)]1\nk\nx\n= x(log log x -log log\n) ∼x(log log x -log log\nx log x) ∼x log 2.\nk\nNotation explanation: Let f and g be functions of x. The notation\nf ≍g denotes that f(x)/g(x) is bounded above and below by posi\ntive numbers for large values of x. The notation f = O(g) denotes\nthat ∃c such that f(x)\ncg(x). The notation f ∼g denotes that\nf(x)\n|\n| ≤\nlimx→inf, g(x) = 1\n5. Average value of primitive pythagorean triangles\nwith hypotenuse equal to n\nLet P(n) be the number of primitive Pythagorean triangles with\nhypotenuse equal to n. For example, P(5)=1 and and P(65)=2 because\n32 + 42 = 52 ,\n332 + 562 = 632 + 162 = 652\nWe would like to determine whether the average value of P(n) con\nverges, and if so, to what value. That is,\nP(1) + ... + P(n)\nlim\n= K\nn→inf\nn\nRather than approaching this problem through mathematical argu\nments, we will use computer computations to infer a value. For each\nvalue of n from 1 to 1000, we generate and graph the average values\nup to and including n. Looking at Figure 1, we see that the average\nvalues (measured on the vertical axis) oscillate, but as n →inf, the\n\nROSE WONG\n0.2\n0.18\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\nFigure 1.

Average value of divisors of a natural numbers\nLet d(n) be the number of divisors of the natural number n. We will\nshow that\nTheorem 6.1. The average value of the number of divisors of natural\nnumbers grows like log n.\nd(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) ∼log n\nn\nProof. Let k be a fixed integer. If we list the multiples of k less than\nor equal to n:\nn\nk, 2k, 3k, ...[ ]k,\nk\nwe find that there are [n\nk] multiples, where [ ] denotes the floor function.\nEach of those multiples contributes 1 to the sum d(1) + ... + d(n).\nIf we examine multiples of all integers k ≤n, it follows that summing\nover k gives\nn\nX n\n[ ] = d(1) + ... + d(n)\nk\nk=1\n\nP\nP\n\nAVERAGE VALUES OF ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS\nNow, we want to prove that\nn\nk=1[n]\nlim\nk = 1\nn→inf n log n\nFirst, we establish the relationship:\nn\nn\nn\nk -1 < [k ] ≤k .\nSumming over k gives:\nn\nn\nn\nX n\nX n\nX n\n(k -1) <\n[ ] ≤\n.\nk\nk\nk=1\nk=1\nk=1\nWe then factor out n to get:\nn\nX 1\nn\nX n\nn\nX 1\nn\n(k -n ) <\n[k ] ≤n\nk\nk=1\nk=1\nk=1\nThe first and last term in the above inequality can be rewritten as\nthe integrals n\nR\nn( k\n1 -n\n1 ) dk and n\nR\nn\nk\n1 dk.\nIntegrating gives\nn\nX n\nn log n -n + 1 <\n[ ] ≤n log n.\nk\nk=1\nSo taking n →inf, we have\nn\n[n]\nlim\nk=1 k = 1.\nn→inf n log n\nAnd so,\nd(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) ∼log n.\nn\nReferences\n[1] Moser, L., \"On the Sum of Consecutive Primes,\" Notes on Number Theory III,\nCanadian Mathematical Bulletin 6, p 159-161, 1963.\n[2] Young, Robert M., \"Excursions in Calculus,\" The Mathematical Association of\nAmerica, USA, 1992."

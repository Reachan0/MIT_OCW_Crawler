      "content": "16.852J/ESD.61J\nTeam Assignment\nFall 2005\nOverview\nThis is a team assignment to evaluate how an entire enterprise delivers value to its\nstakeholders (especially the end customer), from concept generation of the product/service to\nfinal product/service delivery and support to end customers. This will encompass analyzing and\nevaluating the current process flow in terms of resource requirements, people, budget allocation,\ntime involved in each step/activity, etc.\nIn addition, current information flows, tools,\ntechnologies and enterprise metrics employed will be identified. Sources of enterprise waste are\nto be identified and measured. Teams will be required to develop a Lean Vision for the\nenterprise that will deliver value to stakeholders in a more streamlined, waste-free manner.\nFinally, a transition plan will be developed which outlines the steps involved in migrating from\nthe current state to the Lean Vision state. This will include prioritizing \"lean\" projects that the\nbusiness unit should perform including key organizational, information and technology enablers.\nIt is assumed that appropriate organization personnel will be interviewed and that actual\ndata will be utilized to represent times, resources, etc. Company confidential data may be\ndisguised or normalized as required.\nYou are encouraged to work on a company or organization that you or one of your team\nmembers are involved in. The final presentation should be geared toward the enterprise leader of\nthe organization that you have chosen. The presentation will be accompanied by a written\nreport. The final report should be the culmination of the individual steps of the assignments due\nthroughout the semester, as outlined in the following pages.\nEmploy the Enterprise Value\nStream Mapping and Analysis (EVSMA) document as a further guide to the completion of each\nof these steps.\n\nEVSMA STEPS\nSTEP 1: Define the Enterprise\nPart A: Enterprise Description (due Sept 26)\nChoose a company/organization to analyze. If the enterprise which you are currently\nanalyzing is too expansive, you may choose a specific product line on which you will work\n(please clear with Course Instructor). The enterprise you select to study, however, must span the\nproduct life cycles processes, i.e. customer requirement definition, product and process\ndevelopment, production, assembly, suppliers, distribution and support. It must also consider\nenabling support functions such as Finance, Human Resources and IT. Appropriate leadership\nprocesses should also be included. Your description should include product/service lines, market\nsegments targeted, major competitors, market position, sales volume (for this particular\nenterprise) and workforce make-up and size.\nWrite a team memo (a charter following the template provided in the guide is optional).\nPlease be sure to include your team members' names and contact information. Also list the role\nof each team member as agreed upon by the team, including designating one person as a point of\ncontact for your team.\nDeliverables:\n1. Two to three pages describing the enterprise you have selected and the requirements\nexplained above. The description should include a specification of the boundaries of the\nenterprise and identification of its major processes.\n2. A team memo as described above.\nPart B: Strategic Goals/Objectives (due Sept 28)\nIdentify the major driving forces of the external environment in which your defined\nenterprise operates. Through interviews with company executives/managers, review of company\nliterature (annual reports, etc.) and the general business literature, determine the major strategic\nissues facing your enterprise. Provide a summary of the strategic plan for your enterprise in\nterms of its mission, goals and objectives.\nDeliverable:\nTwo to four pages describing the strategic issues of the organization and their current\nchallenges. Describe their current strategic goals and objectives for addressing/meeting these\nissues.\n\nPart C: Describe Stakeholders, Processes and Metrics (due Oct 3)\nIdentify Stakeholders, Processes and Metrics\nIn this step you will identify the key stakeholders, high level processes and metrics\ncurrently employed by the enterprise.\n1) Stakeholders\nIdentify who are the end customer(s) and end user(s) of your enterprise. In addition,\nidentify other stakeholders of your enterprise (partners, suppliers, employees, stockholders,\nleadership, society, and union (if necessary). Explicitly list and group the major entities for each\nstakeholder category.\n2) Processes\nIdentify the high level processes for your enterprise. Develop a high level map of\nproduct life cycle flow from concept generation of the product to final product delivery and\nsupport to the end customer (example: customer requirement definition, concept generation,\nproduct and process development, manufacturing, delivery and support). Develop the product\nvalue stream map as the enterprise currently operates, not as you perceive that it should operate.\nThe product value stream map should include no more than 25 steps.\nOverlay key enabling infrastructure processes (finance, human resources, etc.) and\nleadership processes. Refer to the lean enterprise process architecture.\n3) Enterprise Metrics\nIdentify the metrics currently being used to monitor enterprise performance. What are\nthe target values for these metrics?\nDeliverables:\n- List of stakeholders\n- High level enterprise process value stream(s)\n- Enterprise metrics\n- Provide a brief discussion of any preliminary insights or observations you may\nhave on these three areas.\n\nSTEP 2: COLLECT DATA (due Oct 12)\nIn preparation for Step 3 you will be collecting data on costs, stakeholders, processes, and\nmetrics. You may want to collect the data in parallel, rather than independently, particularly if\nyou are making a site visit and/or performing interviews. NOTE: LESAT assessment has been\ndeferred until STEP 4.\n1) Identify Enterprise Costs\nWhat are the major sources of cost in the enterprise, e.g., direct labor, facilities, overhead,\nmaterials, etc. How much of the cost is coming from the supply chain?\nDeliverable:\n-\nPrepare a pie chart depicting information about the enterprise cost breakdown\n2) Define the Value Exchange Between each Stakeholder\nIn this step you will specify the value exchange between each of the stakeholders identified\nin Step 2.1 above and the enterprise. For the customer/end user, think about what their needs\n(what do they really value?) and requirements are in terms of product or service, delivery\nlead times, price, quality, etc. Then take a look at your enterprise as it is today and describe\nthe product/service it is providing in terms of the same performance factors.\nSpecify the value needed and the value contributed for each of the other stakeholders of the\nenterprise, e.g., Suppliers/Partners, Employees, Shareholders, Society, Union (if any), and\nthe Leadership\nDeliverable:\n-\nCompleted Stakeholder Value Exchange Templates\n.\n3) Collect Individual Process Data\nIdeally we would like to identify the approximate cycle time, headcount and cost associated\nwith each process identified in Step 1.C.2 above. At a minimum obtain the approximate\nheadcount associated with each process. If you encounter difficulty getting specific financial\ndata, the numbers can be normalized (% instead of $). Employ the EXCEL Spreadsheet\nprovided or create your own to enter the data.\nDeliverable:\n-\nSpreadsheet with process data\n4) Metrics\nCollect the trend data for the metrics identified in Step 1.\nDeliverable:\na. Metric trend data\n\nStep 3: Construct Current State Perspectives\nIn this step you will analyze the information you have collected on stakeholders, processes, and\nmetrics.\nPart A: Assess the Value Exchange Between Each Stakeholder and the\nEnterprise (due Oct 19)\nInterview enterprise managers and individual stakeholders (if possible) and chart Relative\nImportance vs Current Performance for the several major factors contributing to value for each\nstakeholder identified in Step 2.\nAlso compare the relative importance to the enterprise of each stakeholder. Use the templates\nprovided.\nDeliverables:\n- Completed Stakeholder Performance Templates and Stakeholder Value Comparison\nTemplates.\n- One to two pages discussing value delivery to the various stakeholders, highlighting\ndiscrepancies between current performance and relative importance of these values\nPart B: Analyze Current Enterprise Process Performance (due Oct 24)\n1) Individual Processes\nAnalyze the process data that you collected in Step 2.\nDeliverables:\n- One to two pages that identify any insights you have gleaned. For example, explain how\nthe cycle times relate to the strategic timing requirements of the product/service. Are\nthere any imbalances in the resources (headcount or costs)? What processes have the\nmajority of the headcount associated with them? Identify any other issues that surface.\n2) Process Interactions\nIdentify key flows of information, materials, and resources, including enabling support\nfunctions as well as life cycle functions. In analyzing the flows, consider the following\nfactors:\nstability, timeliness, accuracy, completeness, format, accessibility, quantity,\nusefulness, redundancies, iterations, etc. Use the Interaction spreadsheet or another analysis\nmethod of your choosing.\nDeliverables:\n- Interaction spreadsheet\n- Five to ten pages describing your analysis of the key interactions within the\nenterprise. Identify issues, insights, and opportunities for improvements\n\nPart C: Analyze the Enterprise Metrics (due Oct 26)\nRefer to the metrics currently being used at the enterprise level identified in Step 2. What are the\ntrends over the past several periods (months, quarters, etc.)? How do the current values compare\nto the target metric values? Based on this information, how well is the enterprise achieving its\nstrategic objectives? Compare the enterprise metrics employed to the criteria for good metrics\npresented in class. Do the enterprise metrics flow down to other parts of the organization in a\nlogically consistent manner?\nDeliverable: Three to five pages discussing the metrics issues outlined above. Include any new\ninsights or observations you have made.\nPart D: \"X-Matrix\" Evaluation of Process/Stakeholder/Metric/Strategic\nObjective Interrelationships (due Oct 31)\nUsing the \"X-matrix\" template perform an evaluation of the interrelationship of each of\nthese key areas. How well do the enterprise metrics measure the strategic objectives? Do the\nenterprise processes have appropriate metrics?\nAre the strategic objectives aligned with\ndelivering stakeholder value? Do the enterprise processes deliver value to the stakeholders?\nRefer to the EVSMA document for additional guidance.\nDeliverables:\n- X-Matrix\n- Five to ten pages describing your analysis of the key interactions within the\nenterprise. Identify issues, insights, and opportunities for improvements.\n\nSTEP 4: Identify Enterprise Opportunities\nPart A: LESAT Assessment (due Nov 7)\nConduct an organizational assessment of lean progress and \"readiness to change\" using\nthe Lean Enterprise Self-Assessment Tool (LESAT). Use the LESAT Summary Sheets to record\npresent and desired lean levels, focusing primarily on the \"current\" levels.\nDeliverables: Three to five pages summarizing the LESAT evaluation results. Identify the\nissues for each of the three LESAT sections implied by the evaluation. How do these sets of\nissues relate? How do these issues compare to those you identified in previous steps?\nPart B: Enterprise Waste (due Nov 9)\nIdentify sources of enterprise-level waste using the six categories identified in the\nEVSMA document. Consider all the previous analyses, including the results of your LESAT\nassessment to determine sources of waste. Based on your analyses, identify opportunities for\nimprovement at the enterprise level.\nDeliverables:\n- Five pages summarizing the type and extent of enterprise level wastes.\n- Identify opportunities for improvement. This should be a summary of all the\nopportunities for improvement identified from previous steps (but save the solutions for\nStep 5).\nInterim Presentation (due Nov 14)\nStep 4 marks the transition from considering as-is state of the enterprise to developing a\nfuture state. This is a natural point for a review of progress made thus far.\nDeliverables: A ten-minute presentation followed by a five-minute question period. The\npresentation should provide a brief overview of the enterprise and then discuss its current state\nusing the information collected in steps 1-4.\n\nSTEP 5: Describe Future State Vision (due Nov 21)\nSteps 1 and 2 of the Team Assignment had you describe/characterize the particular\nenterprise that you chose to analyze and to define \"value\" to the end customer and to the other\nkey enterprise stakeholders. Steps 3-4 had you dig deeply into the enterprise as it is currently\nconstituted. You have analyzed the customer and strategic requirements, metrics employed,\ncycle times, resource utilization, interactions, and sources of waste.\nThis analysis provides a\nmeasure of the degree of \"leanness\" of your enterprise. Now in Step 5 of the Team Assignment,\nyou will have the opportunity to create and describe a \"Lean Enterprise Vision\" for your\norganization.\nDefine the future state of your enterprise as you believe it should look approximately five\nyears out. Create a clear vision of the characteristics of your enterprise based on what you have\nlearned from course lectures, readings, and your own imagination as to what might be possible.\nIf appropriate, develop a new Value Stream Map of your future enterprise, considering\nthe same elements as in your analysis in Step 3. Contrast this to your enterprise's current Value\nStream Map.\nHow would the cycle times be different?\nWhat would be the resource\nrequirements? How would information now flow? To what extent has waste been eliminated?\nGive consideration to all the stakeholders. What will the customer relationships and\nsatisfaction metrics look like in your new enterprise? How about interactions/relationships with\nsuppliers/partners? What kind of working environment will your employees have? What will be\nthe characteristics of your enterprise leadership? What kind of organizational structure will you\nneed to support this new value stream? What will your stockholders have to say about this lean\nenterprise? What view will the Union (if any) have? Will the new enterprise have a different\nimpact on society?\nReview the key issues you identified earlier. Then perform a gap analysis between your\n\"As is\" state and your envisioned \"To be\" state. What are the key differences? What are the\ncritical processes/functional areas that require significant focus to achieve your future vision and\nto satisfy your strategic objectives? Where are the significant technology/information gaps?\nHow will you know when you have achieved your vision? Identify the metrics you\nwould use at the enterprise level to measure progress toward attaining the vision. Identify the\nkey strategic issues of your future enterprise and make sure that the metrics employed map\nagainst those strategic issues. How will the metrics flow down to other parts of the organization?\nDeliverable: Utilize the number of pages you feel is required to convey your new enterprise\nvision.\n\nStep 6: Create Transformation Plan (due Nov 28)\nIn this section you will describe how to get from your current state (Step 4) to your\nenterprise's new enterprise vision (Step 5). You will be making recommendations to your senior\nexecutives on how to transform your enterprise to a lean one.\nFirst, identify potential opportunities for significant improvement and prioritize areas of\nfocus. For example, where would you recommend that your enterprise leader start? Shop floor?\nProduct development? Suppliers? Some combination of the above? Identify key high-level\nprojects that should be undertaken to achieve the desired transformation and prioritize these on\nthe basis of relative importance using the Improvement Idea Prioritization Template.\nMap out a high-level transition plan. Use a chart to display the key elements noting the\ntime frame for each. Specify any precedence relationships among the opportunities and any\nenabling activities.\nThis transition plan should take into consideration information and technology enablers,\nrecommendations on new process initiatives (e.g., IPPD) and potential alternative organizational\nstructures. What are the training requirements? What other recommendations might you have\nfor your executives on transformation requirements?\nFinally, identify any barriers that you perceive to making this transition. What mitigating\nstrategies might you suggest?\nDeliverable: Utilize whatever numbers of pages you feel are required to convey your plan.\n\nFINAL REPORT AND PRESENTATION\nFinal Report (due Dec 14)\nThe final report will be the culmination of Steps 1-6. You can assemble each of the\nsections that you prepared previously into a single document if you like. The following two\nadditions are required: First, add another section to Steps 3-6 that summarizes all the key issues\nthat you gleaned from your analysis. What are the critical dimensions of your enterprise that\nneed enhancement? Second, add a one to two page Executive Summary at the front of your\nreport\nPresentation (due Dec 7, 12 or Dec 14 as assigned)\nThe final presentations will be held in the first week of December.\nGear your\npresentation to your enterprise executive. Assume that you are presenting your management with\nan assessment of the current lean state of your company (Steps 3 and 4), a portrayal of what your\nfuture lean enterprise could be (Step 5), and your recommendations on what will be required to\nget there (Step 6). Use your value stream maps (before and after) to illustrate the different states.\nA prioritized transition plan should be included. The presentation should consider all the\ndimensions of the enterprise - people, processes, technology, and information. It should also\ninclude your recommendation of an appropriate Value Proposition for the enterprise relative to\nyour proposal.\nYou will have a maximum of 20 minutes to give your presentation. This will be followed\nby a period of questions/discussion for approximately 10 minutes. Times will be strictly adhered\nto. You may use any number of different presenters from your team that you desire.\nDeliverables: Please submit both your report and presentation. At the time of\nyour final presentation, please bring four paper copies of the presentation. Please bring two\ncopies of your final report to the last day of classes on December 14."

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nLean Enterprise Self-Assessment Tool (LESAT)\nCase Studies for Enterprise Transformation Training\nCASE 1 - Advanced Composite Aerostructures Incorporated\nPrepared by Cory R. A. Hallam, LAI/TMP Doctoral Candidate, October 2001\nCases are constructed from data and information obtained while researching U.S. aerospace firms within\nMIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative consortium. The exact data and corporate information do not in any way\nreflect a single U.S. aerospace firm that participated in the MIT research. Each case is constructed from\ndata from multiple participants, and appropriately modified in order to demonstrate a particular\nmanagement issue associated with Lean Enterprise Transformation.\nIntroduction\nAdvanced Composite Aerostructures Incorporated (ACAI) is a Virginia-based company\nwith annual revenues of $400 million US dollars. ACAI produces non-primary composite\nstructural components for commercial Aircraft and Spacecraft manufacturers, as well as\nin-service replacement parts for DOD customers. The company employs 2200 people,\nhas in-house staff for marketing, finance, human resources (HR), product design,\nengineering, manufacturing, and customer support, and has a base of 225 suppliers.\nACAI is very functionally oriented, and is managed by a president and executive\ncommittee representing each of the functional groups.\nSince 1994, there have been sporadic attempts at becoming lean, mostly due to several\nshop-floor managers who were intrigued in the concept of lean after attending a\nconference on Lean Manufacturing. The company achieved several successes in\nmanufacturing between 1994 and 2000 and created several component production lines\nthat were able to produce in single-piece flow, mainly due to cellular reorganization of\nthe production process. The lead-time on these components dropped by 58 percent, and\nwork in progress (WIP) was cut from weeks of inventory to hours of inventory. While\nthese successes were applauded by the director of manufacturing, there has been little\nchange elsewhere in the company to become even leaner. Subsequently, the shop\n(c) Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 1\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nmanagers left the company after becoming frustrated by the demands placed on them by\nfinancial tracking systems, expediters, MRP systems, warehouse managers, and\npurchasers that were not allowing the value-delivery process to become even leaner.\nFaced with the issue of winning new contracts, and hiring new managers who spoke the\nlanguage of Lean, ACAI's president decided to create a position for VP of Lean who\nwould address the issue of hiring new managers and coordinating the lean production\nsystem. After a lengthy search, a suitable candidate, David Stonegarth, was found and\nhired as the VP of Lean for ACAI.\nThe new VP was familiar with the work the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's\n(MIT) Lean Aerospace Initiative (LAI) had been doing on lean transformation. After a\nlengthy review of ACAI's past efforts David informed the president, Steven Jameson, that\nthe issue of \"Enterprise Transformation\" was the logical next step for the company as\nmany of the issues identified by the managers who had left the company were related to\nthe whole organization, and not just the manufacturing function. The new VP of Lean\nproposed that they perform an assessment using MIT's Lean Enterprise Self-Assessment\nTool (LESAT) as a means of identifying their strengths and weaknesses with respect to\ncreating a Lean Enterprise at ACAI. The President agreed to this only if the new VP\nassured him that it would require minimal time from ACAI's executive staff, as he didn't\nwant to burden them with extra paperwork.\nLESAT Sessions\nDavid (the new VP of Lean) spent months getting the executives of ACAI to agree to a\ndate where their schedules would all have a mutual availability for a one-hour meeting.\nUsing the briefing material provided by MIT, David gave a 1 hour review of the LESAT\ntool and provided instructions for the managers to complete the assessment on their own\n- a task he said would take 1 to 2 hours. He then explained that a follow-up meeting\nwould be held to discuss the results of the assessment.\n(c) Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 2\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nThe ACAI executives left the meeting with their LESAT books in hand and with\ninstructions to get their results to David within three weeks. Over the three weeks, David\nfielded calls from executives wanting to know what was meant by terminology such as\n\"extended value stream\", \"enterprise flow\", \"designing the future value stream\", etc. By\nthe end of week three only four of the 12 participants had returned their assessments.\nDavid began calling the executives and was faced with common responses such as \"I'm\nvery busy and will get to it when I have a chance.\" Finally, after pleading with the\npresident for some support, the executives were forced to complete the assessment and\nDavid received all of the data. With some compilation and number crunching in an\nelectronic spreadsheet, David had the assessment results and was ready to organize a\npost-assessment discussion session for the executives.\nLESAT Results\nBased on the LESAT assessments done by the 12 participants, David compiled the\nfollowing LESAT Averages for the X.X-level of the assessment, as presented in Table 1\nbelow. The full list of current-state LESAT results is provided in appendix A.\nSection I - Lean\nAverage = 1.8\nTransformation/Leadership\nI.A Enterprise Strategic Planning\n1.7\nI.B Adopt Lean Paradigm\n1.4\nI.C Focus on the Value Stream\n1.7\nI.D Develop Lean Structure and Behavior\n2.4\nI.E Create and Refine Transformation Plan 1.7\nI.F Implement Lean Initiatives\n1.2\nI.G Focus on Continuing Improvement\n1.5\nSection II - Life-Cycle Processes\nAverage = 2.3\nII.A Business Acquisition and Program\n2.2\nManagement\nII.B Requirements Definition\n2.3\nII.C Develop Product and Process\n2.6\nII.D Manage Supply Chain\n2.0\nII.E Produce Product\n2.7\nII.F Distribute and Service Product\n2.4\nSection III - Enabling Infrastructure\nAverage = 1.9\nIII.A Lean Organizational Enablers\n1.8\nIII.B Lean Process Enablers\n2.0\nTable 1 - Level X.X Average LESAT Rating\n(c) Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 3\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nWith this data in hand, David prepared to present the results to executive management.\nFor the briefing, David first provided a review of the purpose of the LESAT tool, and\nthen reminded the executives of the definitions associated with the 5 levels of the\ncapability maturity model used in the assessment (Appendix B). David presented the\ngeneral results shown in Table 1 as his high-level summary. As appeared the case, most\nof the data suggested that there was a general awareness of lean with informal approaches\ndeployed in a few areas with varying degrees of effectiveness and sustainment. Seeing\nthese results, one of the executives commented:\n\"I have to say that I am quite shocked with how low we scored on this tool, since\nwe have been doing lean for seven years at ACAI. Is this LESAT tool measuring\nthe right aspects of our business, or were we overzealous in extolling the gains\nachieved by our previous lean improvements in manufacturing? I thought we\nwould have performed much better on this assessment.\"\nDavid proceeded by discussing the fact that the LESAT tool was aimed at assessing\nEnterprise-level lean transformation, of which the previous efforts at lean manufacturing\nwere only a small subset. If one considered the items of the assessment related to the\nmanufacturing elements of the enterprise (such as Section II.E.2 in particular), they were\nscoring significantly higher than the areas such as strategic planning (Section I.A). At this\npoint the director of Engineering, Elizabeth Hartley, spoke up and added:\n\"David, based on the results you just discussed, I question the validity of this tool.\nWhile we scored low in strategic planning on the tool, we all know that each\nfunctional manager does strategic planning for his or her functional group for\nboth an annual plan and a 5-year outlook plan. Our functional organizations are\ndefinitely better than a 1.7. How can we score low on enterprise strategic\nplanning when everyone in the enterprise's executive management does strategic\nplanning for his or her respective function? \"\n(c) Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 4\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nThis point raised several further questions about the tool that were focussed very much on\nwhat each functional group was doing. Many of the executives were convinced that their\nfunctions should have scored much more highly than the overall average suggested. The\ndiscussion then stayed on the issue of functional assessment versus enterprise assessment\nfor quite a while.\nAt this point in the event the executives were struggling with the many inter-functional\nissues that began to hit the table in addition to the overall low scores of the LESAT.\nDavid suggested that they review the particular line items in the LESAT assessment that\nscored very low (Appendix A) to frame the discussions and to hopefully help understand\nwhy they had arrived at the LESAT results they were faced with. Noting that their\nscheduled hour was up, the president decided to cast an executive decision:\n\"Folks, there is obviously more to this assessment than meets the eye. We have\nscored very low on this first assessment, but I am confident that we could do much\nbetter the next time around. I suggest that since he is the VP of lean, we task\nDavid with working on a plan that will increase all of our scores to a level 3 by\nthe next review period in six months. Then we can set a goal of level 4's and 5's\nfor the next year to make sure we have a world-class ranking.

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nLean Enterprise Self-Assessment Tool (LESAT)\nCase Studies for Enterprise Transformation Training\nCASE 2 - Electronic Systems Incorporated\nPrepared by Cory R. A. Hallam, LAI/TMP Doctoral Candidate, November 2001\nCases are constructed from data and information obtained while researching U.S. aerospace firms\nwithin MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative consortium. The exact data and corporate information do not in\nany way reflect a single U.S. aerospace firm that participated in the MIT research. Each case is\nconstructed from data from multiple participants, and appropriately modified in order to demonstrate a\nparticular management issue associated with Lean Enterprise Transformation.\nIntroduction\nElectronic Systems Incorporated (ESI) is an electronics systems company with facilities\nin California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas. ESI has four primary business units,\nnamely Radar (commercial and military), Data Bus Design and Integration (commercial\nand military), Electronic Warfare System Integration Services, and Fire Control System\nDevelopment. The company runs each business unit as a separate enterprise serving\nindividual customers, but share common support services such as Finance, Human\nResources (HR), Business Development, and Procurement, each of which functions as a\ncost center for the company. ESI employs 11 000 people, has annual revenues of $1.9\nbillion US dollars, and has over 450 suppliers.\nESI has been a member of MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative (LAI) consortium for two\nyears, and has sent their business unit executives to the annual LAI plenary conference,\nExecutive Board meetings and some of the LAI lean workshops. The president of ESI,\nRay Leblanc, is convinced that the changing landscape of the aerospace industry is\ncreating a need for ESI to find a new source of competitive advantage in the commercial\nside of its businesses, while making itself more attractive to its military customers in its\ndefense contracts. In Ray's opinion, the future of ESI is to create a lean enterprise. He is\nbanking on the fact that transforming to a lean enterprise will reduce overall operating\n(c)Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 1\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\ncosts, increase profitability, make the company more competitive on government\ncontracts, and provide better returns to their shareholders. While Ray wants to transform\nquickly, he is unsure of the state of leanness of his company. He knows that the business\nunits have some very good managers, but overall is uncertain about the understanding or\nuse of lean principles within the organization.\nIn the past 3 months, Ray Leblanc promoted Allison Hughes from VP of the Radar\nbusiness unit to VP of Lean for ESI as a means to orchestrate his lean goals across the\nenterprise. Working closely with Allison, and the executive committee comprised of the\nbusiness unit and cost center leaders, Ray has initiated a strategic planning process with\nLean at the core of the operations philosophy for the company. Guided by LAI's\nTransition to Lean (TTL) Roadmap, Allison has helped coordinate the lean\ntransformation planning and decided that an assessment was necessary to establish a\nbaseline understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of ESI with respect to becoming\na lean Enterprise. Within days of the strategic planning sessions, Allison began preparing\nto use LAI's Lean Enterprise Self-Assessment Tool (LESAT) with the business unit and\ncost center leaders as a means to understand the current state of leanness in each of these\ngroups at ESI.\nLESAT Sessions\nThe first LESAT introductory session was planned and executed within a month's time.\nDr. Deborah Nightingale, Dr. Joe Mize, and Cory Hallam from the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology were present for the first LESAT introduction session. Dr.\nNightingale provided an overview of the tool, and then Allison described how the\nassessment would be performed. It was her intention that the executives would take the\nassessment back to their respective business unit or support function and perform the\nassessment with their respective senior management committees. She would then collect\nall of the results and compile them to get an overall picture of the state of leanness of\nESI. Ray Leblanc asked that the executives make this assessment a priority for\nthemselves and their senior staff. Specifically, Ray said:\n(c)Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 2\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\n\"Folks, it is my opinion that the move towards a lean enterprise is at the core of\nour future success. I am considering the work that Allison is doing in this\nassessment a priority for all of us, as it will establish a better understanding of\nwhere we are and where we need to go as a lean enterprise.\"\nThe ESI executives left the meeting with their LESAT books in hand, and with\ninstructions to get their results to Allison within two week's time. While there were some\nquestions for Allison to field during the assessment period, all of the results were in\nwithin two weeks. Using a spreadsheet, Allison compiled all of the results and began\npreparing for the report-out session. It took some effort to coordinate schedules, but the\nexecutives at ESI were able to find a common time to meet the following week.\nLESAT Results\nAllison began the report-out session by reviewing the purpose of the LESAT with the\nexecutives. She then reminded them of the generic definitions associated with the\ncapability maturity model used in the assessment (Appendix A). Allison presented the\ngeneral results shown in Table 1 as her high-level summary and commented on the fact\nthat their overall assessment of about a level 2 indicated that there was a general\nawareness of lean with informal approaches deployed in a few areas with varying degrees\nof effectiveness.\nSection I - Lean\nAverage = 2.2\nTransformation/Leadership\nI.A Enterprise Strategic Planning\n2.8\nI.B Adopt Lean Paradigm\n2.7\nI.C Focus on the Value Stream\n1.7\nI.D Develop Lean Structure and Behavior\n2.2\nI.E Create and Refine Transformation Plan 2.3\nI.F Implement Lean Initiatives\n1.6\nI.G Focus on Continuing Improvement\n1.9\nSection II - Life-Cycle Processes\nAverage = 2.2\nII.A Business Acquisition and Program\n2.5\nManagement\nII.B Requirements Definition\n2.4\nII.C Develop Product and Process\n2.9\nII.D Manage Supply Chain\n1.7\n(c)Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 3\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nII.E Produce Product\n1.8\nII.F Distribute and Service Product\n1.8\nSection III - Enabling Infrastructure\nAverage = 1.7\nIII.A Lean Organizational Enablers\n1.9\nIII.B Lean Process Enablers\n1.5\nTable 1 - Level X.X Average LESAT Results\nAdditionally, it was pointed out that their enabling infrastructure was averaging below a\nlevel 2 in the assessment. The full list of current-state LESAT results is provided in\nAppendix B, including the average LESAT practice values based on all eight respondents\nand the ranges* in responses. Seeing these results, the director of Data Bus Design and\nIntegration, Sandra Evans, had several questions:\n\"How does this compare to our competitors in industry? Are we scoring too\nlow? What does this score mean to us?\"\nAllison reminded the executives that the assessment was an internal perception of their\nmaturity, and not an industry standard tool for comparing multiple companies. She\ncontinued by saying that the meaning of the results is a statement of their current leanness\nas per the description of the 54 LESAT measures. Ray Leblanc then said:\n\"I think we have to realize that we are only just starting this transformation\nprocess. We are obviously doing better in some areas than others. The areas\nwhere we are not doing as well should be an indication of a need we have to\naddress.\"\nThe discussion in the meeting then centered on a review of each of the LESAT X.X-level\naverages provided in Table 1. The executives reviewed each result, then discussed the\nimpact the result would have on their lean transformation plan. While this seemed to sit\nwell with the business unit leaders, some of the support function executives were having\n* The range is a measure of the variability in responses and is calculated as the highest maturity level -\nthe lowest maturity level for the set of responses to a given LESAT practice.\n(c)Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 4\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nsome difficulty understanding their role in the whole value stream process. James\nDevans, the director of Finance, spoke up:\n\"I can understand that we have to improve in areas like focusing on the value\nstream, where we scored a 1.7, or managing the supply chain, where we also\nscored a 1.7, but I am unclear of how the Finance department provides value to\nthe end customer. I would like to figure this out\"\nThis point raised several further questions about how the value stream was defined and\nfrom whose perspective. Was it solely the customer's perspective, or did each function\ndeliver a product/service to the business units via a separate value stream? Also, some of\nthe executives were wondering how they would allocate resources to act on some of the\ntransformation plans that they were going to develop. How would they prioritize their\nactions, since the effort required for the number of actions would most likely be greater\nthan the available resources? The discussions were enthusiastic and the participants\nseemed to have a common desire to figure out how they would enable the transformation\nof the enterprise. With time running out in the meeting, Ray Leblanc decided to wrap up\nthe meeting with some final comments and actions:\n\"I think we have uncovered some good insights into our current leanness. We\nshould not be worried about our exact score, but rather what the individual\nLESAT levels are telling us about ESI's current lean maturity. We have already\nidentified some actionable issues, and can incorporate them in our strategic\nplans. Since Allison is the VP of lean, I suggest we task her with helping us\nprioritize actions identified from this assessment and we should then reconvene\nin about a month to coordinate and agree upon our transformation plans, both\nfor this fiscal year and for the long term as well.\"\nThe executive committee applauded Allison's effort for orchestrating the assessment\nprocess and were excited about the next steps. Allison went to lunch and spent several\nhours reviewing the LESAT data.\n(c)Cory Hallam, MIT, 2001\nPage 5\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nLean Aerospace Initiative\nQuestions for Discussion\n1.

management represents a new\nway of thinking about supplier networks\n- Lean principles require cooperative supplier\nrelationships while balancing cooperation and\ncompetition\n- Cooperation involves a spectrum of collaborative\nrelationships & coordination mechanisms\n- Supplier partnerships & strategic alliances\nrepresent a key feature of lean supply chain\nmanagement\nESD.61J / 16.852J: Integrating the Lean Enterprise\nPage 2\n(c) Deborah Nightingale, 2005\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nTheory: Lean Represents a \"Hybrid\"\nApproach to Organizing Interfirm\nRelationships\n-\n\"Markets\" (Armʼs Length): Lower production costs, higher coordination costs\n-\nFirm buys (all) inputs from outside specialized suppliers\n-\nInputs are highly standardized; no transaction-specific assets\n-\nPrices serve as sole coordination mechanism\n-\n\"Hierarchies\" (Vertical Integration): Higher production costs, lower\ncoordination costs\n-\nFirm produces required inputs in-house (in the extreme, all inputs)\n-\nInputs are highly customized, involve high transaction costs or dedicated investments, and\nrequire close coordination\n-\n\"Lean\" (Hybrid): Lowest production and coordination costs; economically\nmost efficient choice-- new model\n-\nFirm buys both customized & standardized inputs\n-\nCustomized inputs often involve dedicated investments\n-\nPartnerships & strategic alliances provide collaborative advantage\nl\nʼ\ni\nDominant conventional approach: Vertica integration, arm s length\nrelat onships with suppliers\nESD.61J /

As documented earlier, a major thrust of acquisition reform has been to foster\nmilitary-commercial industrial integration. In particular, a number of so called Industrial\nBase Pilot (IBP) programs have been inititated by the DoD to help expedite military-\ncommercial integration. The Manufacturing Technology Directorate (MANTECH), now a\npart of the U.S. Air Force Laboratory, has been the lead agency for key initiatives. One of\nthese initiatives is the Military Products from Commercial Lines (MPCL) program.\nThis chapter will examine this pioneering and successful pilot program, with emphasis on\nits efforts toward integration of the supply chain with the manufacture of electronic\nassemblies. In the first section the background and evolution of the program is discussed,\nalong with an overview of the program structure and organization. The next two sections\ndescribe the defense and commercial industry business practices separately, followed by a\ncomparison of them. Finally, the last section looks at the approach used by the IBP to\novercome the differences in the business practices in each supply chain.\n\n3.2 The Industrial Based Pilot Program\n3.2.1 Background\nThe MPCL program can trace its roots to a major investigation of the defense industrial\nbase initiated by the Air Force Aeronautical Systems Command (ASC) known as\n\"Manufacturing 2005.\" The study found that future industrial base strategy would require\nthe means to operate in an environment of decreasing defense budgets, changing enemy\nthreats, and the new realities of the commercial marketplace (Kinsella, 1996). One major\nconclusion of the 1991 study was that the DoD should facilitate the integration of the\ncommercial and defense industrial sectors. To accommodate such an environment, it was\nrecommended that the DoD make adjustments to maintain a much smaller defense industrial\nbase and to encourage organizational culture and business changes to facilitate this smaller\nand more commercial industrial base.\nSix specific areas of the industrial base were identified by the study as areas for focused\nattention and additional study:\n-\nIntegrated Product and Process Development Methods (IPPD)\n- A focus on quality\n- Commercial and military integration\n-\nInternational sourcing\n- Flexible and Lean manufacturing\n-\nVertical partnering\nFollowing the recommendations of this study, Wright Laboratories at Wright-Patterson Air\nForce Base (WPAFB) issued a Broad Area Announcement (BAA) in 1993 requesting\nproposals to address these areas. It was in response to this BAA that TRW Avionics\nSystems Division (ASD) proposed the dual-use production of F-22 Raptor and RAH-66\nComanche avionics modules. Specifically, the IBP is one program created to establish the\nfeasibility of this type of integrated manufacturing--a principal component of\ncommercial/military integration (Kinsella, 1996).\n3.2.2 Program Description\nThe program that TRW ASD proposed for dual-use manufacturing is the Communication,\nNavigation, and Identification (CNI) Avionics Suite. This electronics suite consists of 38\n\nseparate but fully integrated packaged electronics assemblies, also known as standard\nelectronic modules (SEM), designed with common interfacing specifications for installation\non the new F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter. Additionally, these modules are jointly\ncompatible with the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter program. At the time of the MPCL\nproposal to MANTECH, TRW ASD was already the contracted EMD supplier for these\nCNI avionics modules to both the Air Force and the Army.\nThe dual-use proposal was to subcontract the manufacture of some of these CNI avionics\nmodules to a commercial division of TRW, which produces electronics for the automotive\nand heavy industries markets, known as TRW Automotive Electronics Group (AEG).\nSince TRW AEG produces high volume electronic assemblies that are somewhat similar to\nthe CNI modules, it appeared to be a ripe situation for working through the design,\nmanufacturing, and business issues involved with dual-use manufacturing, while providing\nTRW with a vehicle for technology transfer between operating units of the corporation.\nAlthough the IBP program entails the Dual-Use manufacture of the CNI modules, it is\ncontractually separate from the contracts let to TRW ASD for the EMD phase of the F-22\nprogram and RAH-66 program avionics systems. Figure 3.1 illustrates these relationships.\nFigure 3.1 CNI Electronics Suite Contractual Relationships\nCustomer\nAir Force F-22\nRaptor SPO\nMANTECH WL/MT\nMPCL IBP Program\nArmy RAH-66\nComanche PMO\nPrime\nContractor\nLockheed Martin\nAeronautical Systems\nBoeing/Sikorsky\nJoint PMO\nSub-System\nContractor\nLockheed Martin\nTactical Aircraft Systems\nBoeing DSG\nHelicopter Division\nSupplier-\nTier# 3\nTRW ASD\nSupplier-\nTier #4\nTRW AEG\nSupplier-\nTier #5+\nComponent Suppliers:\nPWB, ASICS, BGA\n(Source: Adapted from Openshaw, 1996)\n\n3.2.2.1 TRW Avionics System Division (ASD) Description\nASD is a subdivision of the larger TRW Space & Electronics Group (SEG) which designs,\nengineers, and manufactures a broad array of military and space products, from unmanned\naerial vehicle systems to electro-optical systems for satellites. In addition to the CNI\navionics suite, ASD develops electronic warfare (EW) products, antenna systems,\nmodeling and simulation software, and also provides leading-edge engineering support\nservices at Air Force Logistics Centers (Aviation Week, 1997).\n3.2.2.2 TRW Automotive Electronics Group (AEG) Description\nThe TRW Automotive Electronics Group is a leading high volume tier-1 and tier-2 supplier\nof electronic assemblies to the automotive and heavy industries markets. The 202,000\nsq.ft. production facility, located in Marshall, Illinois, produces an average of 16,404\nunits/day on six production lines, with annual volume per assembly of 400-800,000 units.\nThese products are delivered to 14 customers in 38 locations.\nCustomers include\nCaterpillar, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, and numerous other automotive original equipment\nmanufacturers (OEM). Current products include electronic safety systems, such as single\npoint sensors and airbag diagnostic units, and electronic convenience systems, such as\nbody and engine computers, transmission controllers, steering controllers, and seat\nmemory modules (Groth, 1997).\nTRW AEG is a full service supplier with strong engineering capabilities. While one\ncustomer may design an electronic assembly and simply source TRW AEG to produce and\ndeliver the final product, others require more engineering involvement. This involvement\nis particularly true with the automotive OEM customers.\nAlthough some product\nassemblies have \"core\" functional designs developed independently by TRW AEG, the\ninterfacing and packaging requirements at a minimum change between customers. TRW\nengineers work on IPTs with the OEMs to design products which utilize either new or\ncurrent \"core\" electronics to meet the performance specifications and cost targets of these\ncustomers (Groth, 1998).\n\n3.2.3 Goals of the IBP Program\nThe IBP program has the stated goal of demonstrating that military products can be\nproduced on a commercial production line with the following characteristics, compared\nwith those produced on a military line:\n-\nlower cost\n- comparable quality\n-\nequivalent functionality\nCritical to the success of the IBP are the implications of flexible manufacturing technologies\nand process technologies which represent key enablers for taking advantage of commercial\nelectronics production lines. Identification of best practices and transferring the lessons\nlearned to the entire defense acquisition community are also key objectives of this program\n(Kinsella, 1996).\n3.2.3.1 \"Four Wins\"\nAt the beginning of the MPCL program, a \"Four Wins\" scenario was defined, which\nestablished the expectations of each of the four major players in the program. The \"Four\nWins\" have been used throughout the program as a basis for making management\ndecisions. Below are the Benefits provided to each major constituent (Kinsella, 1996) .\nTRW AEG (commercial supplier)\nF-22, RAH-66 Program Office\n- Increased business potential resulting\n- 50% cost savings for electronics\nfrom qualification for manufacture of\nmodules\nmilitary hardware\n- Functional equivalence\n- Acquisition of advanced process\n- Schedule compatibility\ntechnology\n- Transfer of business practices to benefit\n- Acquisition of infrastructure technology\nDoD systems\nMANTECH\nTRW ASD (military contractor)\n- Change agent for a commercial-military\n- 50% lower production Cost\nindustrial base\n- 50% reduction in design cycle time\n- Risk reduction for DoD business with\n- Lean enterprise processes\ncommercial manufacturers\n- Seamless partnering with commercial\n- Documentation and transfer of validated\ncompanies\npractices\n- Demonstration of pilot strategy viability\n\n3.2.4 Organization of the Pilot Program\nThe organization of the MPCL pilot program was structured around three integrated\nproduct teams (IPT), with the tasks required to make the program successful allocated to\neach . The goals and objectives of each are described below.\nBusiness Practices and Policies IPT. The overall objective of the Business Practices and\nPolicy IPT (BP&P IPT) was to integrate the military and commercial business practices\nsuch that TRW AEG was excepting and was impacted as little as possible. To this end,\nevery effort was made to utilize the commercial practices already in place at TRW AEG\n(IBP BP IPT, 1995).\nManufacturing Infrastructure IPT. The manufacturing infrastructure IPT (MI IPT) was\ncharged with evaluating, defining, and implementing a concurrent engineering environment\n(CEE) and a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) system.\nThese are two areas\ncritical to the lean product development and production of the CNI electronics modules to\nreduce development time, reduce cost, and improve quality. The management of workflow\nis critical to a successful concurrent engineering environment. These components include\nproduct data, communication between participants, design and manufacturing involvement,\nand concurrent engineering compatible processes (IBP MI IPT, 1995).\nProcess Technology IPT. The objectives of the Process Technology IPT (PT IPT) were\nfocused on commercial and military integration. Specifically the team was tasked with\ncomparing the military and commercial facility processes, selecting detailed designs to\ninclude in the IBP program, developing a cost baseline to understand the cost distribution\nfor the selected designs, and the overall demonstration of Dual-Use compatibility.\nAdditionally, the team was asked to validate the business practices and polices IPT and\nmanufacturing infrastructure IPT recommendations (IBP PT IPT, 1995).\n3.2.5 Module Selection\nModules considered for the IBP program were selected from the CNI Systems of the F-22\nand RAH-66 Comanche under development at ASG. The IBP program sought to pilot\nthree or more of the modules. The module selection criteria were as follows:\n- Commonality among weapons systems--to ensure broad applicability and critique of\nprogram results.\n\n- Multiple use within systems--to maximize production volume/scale economies.\n- High design-to-cost--to maximize cost savings opportunities of IBP program.\n- SEM-E module construction--to utilize existing equipment on the AEG assembly line.\n- Automation compatibility--to minimize line disruption and off-line processes.\n- Digital/Analog Circuitry--to align technology with AEG capabilities.\n- Common ASG/AEG component suppliers--to benefit commercial procurement at AEG.\nBase on these criteria categories and a weighting for each, the Pulse Narrowband Processor\n(PNP) module and the Radio Frequency Front End Controller (RF/FEC) module were\nselected for inclusion in the IBP program. A third module, the Low Latency Signal\nProcessor (LLSP), was selected for a paper design study only (IBP PT IPT, 1995).\n3.3 Defense Industry Practices at TRW ASD\nThis section reviews the business practices and environment at TRW ASD as the \"typical\"\ndefense industry business. Since the industry is going through such drastic changes, the\ndiscussion will focus on the state of the industry in the traditional sense, identifying areas\nof change when appropriate. The material in this section is referenced to both the IBP\nreleased documentation and my site visits in January and February 1998.\n3.3.1 Culture\nCultures vary between countries, cities, business, and industries, so the defense\ncommunity is no different--it is unique. Its difficult to characterize such a diverse group of\ndefense contractors and government departments some generalizations are possible. Based\non my visit to TRW ASD, interaction with defense industry engineerings, and my general\nknowledge of the industry, the defense community can be characterized by the following:\n- A culture that is experienced and trained in applying regulations to a product, not in\nunderstanding the product itself.\n- A focus on obeying rules and laws, leading to a bureaucratic and process driven\nculture.\n- A risk averse culture, which errs on the side of conformity, due to fear of breaking the\nrules--which are law.\n- A focus on meeting military specifications and standards, leading to a \"how to\" culture.\n\n- A culture focused on product performance, not on cost.\n- A culture of individuals who are committed to the safety and well-being of our armed\nforces.\n3.3.2 Sources of New Business Opportunities\nMilitary business opportunities are generally disclosed by the DoD through a BAA and\nrequest for proposal (RFP) announcement in the Business Commerce Daily. Since the\nDoD represents approximately 85% of the market, this is the critical method for finding\nnew opportunities. This is the formal method of procurement announcement, however\nmore than likely informal discussions of the procurement prior to the official announcement\nhave circulated throughout the defense community.\n3.3.3 Business Practices\nThe material in this section on the Business Practices at ASD is referenced from the IBP BP\nIPT documents of 1995 and 1997.\n3.3.3.1 Quality Systems\nThe military standard has been MIL-Q-9858A. This specification has been superseded by\nthe international quality standard ISO 9001.\n3.3.3.2 Parts Control\nMilitary parts approval at TRW ASD falls under MIL-STD-965 Parts Control.\nThis\nstandard requires a lengthy approval processes through three bodies; internally at TRW\nASD, at the contractor, and finally by the Parts Control Board (PCB).\n3.3.3.3 Workmanship Standards\nTRW ASD uses the MIL-STD-2000A workmanship standard. The standard requires\ninspection, customer oversight and audits, and approval of training programs.\nThis\nstandard requires 100% inspection unless defect rates are less than 2700 PPM, as defined\nby the military standards defect criteria. The standard also requires that rework cannot be\nperformed by assembly workers until the product to be reworked has been inspected.\n\n3.3.4 Product Design and Development\n3.3.4.1 Design Specifications\nThe specifications used in the design of defense products have traditionally been military\nspecifications (MILSPECS). Reform initiatives have recently removed the requirement for\nuse of these military unique specifications and standards, replacing them with industry\nspecifications and standards whenever possible.\nThis change was implemented as a\nmandate from the DoD with immediate effect and no gradual implementation, which has\nbeen challenging given how entrenched the military acquisition process is in the use of\nMILSPEC's. In product design, specifications are used for things like material call outs,\ntesting procedures, and environmental operating requirements. These specifications are\nvery detailed and explicit regarding how a design should meet a requirement and are rigid.\nThese specifications are sometimes referred to as \"how to\" specification(Myers, 1998).\n3.3.4.2 Product Design\nThe design of military electronics systems follow the philosophy of placing priority\nemphasis on performance only. Typical designs incorporate many very complex application\nspecific integrated circuits (ASICS), very dense printed circuit board (PCB) component\npopulation, extensive use of digital circuitry, moderate use of RF circuitry, and little use of\nanalog circuitry. Performance in military electronics is delivered through not only the\nprocessing speed and capability of the design, but also through the harsh environmental\nconditions in which the components are capable of operating. For example, extreme\noperating temperatures have lead to the use of ASICS which are encased or \"packaged\" in\nceramic materials and are hermetically sealed (IBP PT IPT, 1995).\nThe method of attaching components to the PCB in the CNI electronics modules is called\n\"surface mounting.\" This method entails screening the PCB with a very thin pattern of\nsolder paste, similar to how a T-shirt would be \"silk screened,\" followed by automated\nplacement of components on the surface of the PCB in the paste, and finally the board and\ncomponents are heated in a re-flow oven for the paste to melt and cure, affixing the\ncomponents to the PCB (Everett, 1998). The two major benefits of surface mount\nprocessing are close placement of components for very high density PCB population and\nminimized overall assembly thickness versus more conventional through-hole attachment.\nDesign for Manufacturing (DFM) is not used to the same extent in the design of defense\nproducts as it is in the design of high volume commercial products. Component size and\n\nplacement are determined based on design requirements for performance and physical\nrequirements for spacing. The high per unit assembly cost forces mid-stream engineering\nchanges to be performed on complete or semi-complete assemblies, leading to the use of\njumper wires and \"cuts\" that are not conducive to easy manufacture. The manual assembly\nenvironment and low volume production allow the flexibility for these methods of product\ndesign to exist.\nEssentially, design and performance are of higher priority than\nmanufacturing efficiency.\n3.3.4.3 Product Validation & Testing\nSince the products, assemblies, and individual components are expensive and produced in\nlow volume, testing is usually limited to a very small sample size. Development tests are\ndone on 100% of the modules and include functional, environmental, thermal cycles,\nvibration/drop, and burn-in. To avoid the use of expensive test hardware, extensive use of\ncomputer simulation modeling is performed (IBP PT IPT, 1995).\n3.3.5 Manufacturing\nTRW ASD manufactures very low volume military electronics. Its manufacturing facility\ncoexists with its engineering offices in San Diego, California. The manufacturing area has\nthe feel and appearance of an electronics laboratory, with work benches and electronic test\nequipment, such as oscilloscopes, arranged in rows (Everett, 1998).\nA handful of\nprocessing equipment is located at one end of the area arranged in order of processing,\nhowever the process is not continuous flow. The ASD manufacturing facility can be\ncharacterized by the following:\n-\nVery low volume craft-shop production\n- Small production area.\n- Low capital investment\n-\nLittle standardization of products\n-\nExtensive use of manual assembly operations\n- Few semi-automated assembly operations\n- Highly skilled labor/technicians\nProduction tests are done on 100% of the modules and include functional, environmental,\nthermal cycles, vibration/drop, and burn-in.\n\n3.3.6 Business Agreements\n3.3.6.1 Contract Regulations\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is the basis for government contracting. It was\nestablished for publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by all\nexecutive agencies.\nThe FAR is the primary document of the Federal Acquisition\nRegulation System, with agency specific acquisition regulations to supplement the FAR.\nThe DoD specific regulations are within the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation\nSupplement (DFARS).\nMilitary procurement contracts include a monumental number of contractual clauses. For\nexample, an analysis of the Apache helicopter Inflatable Body and Head Restraint System\n(IBAHRS) crash sensor contract showed a total of 183 Contractual and 204 Technical\nBusiness Practices and Policy clauses (Kinsella, 1995). Examples of clauses include areas\nsuch as socio-economic employment\nrequirements, surrender of cost information,\nexposure of proprietary technical data, and cost accounting system requirements. Later in\nthis chapter, specific clauses which violate commercial requirements are discussed in detail.\n3.3.6.2 Contract Types\nThere are a number of different types of contracts used for military procurement. The\nunique features of each are summarized below (DoD, 1998).\nCost Type.\nCost type contracts are used to buy products and systems that are the\ncontractors \"Best Effort\" and are typically used for products that are not well-defined and\nalso present high risk. Payments to the contractor are made as incurred.\n- Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)--Fee is same regardless of actual cost.\n- Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)--Fee is adjusted based on actual cost through the use of\na share ratio, and is limited to a min/max fee.\nFixed Price Type. Fixed price type contracts are used to buy well defined products and\nsystems that are \"Delivery Promised\" with defined deliverables and low risk. Cash flows\nto the contractor are made based on the delivery of goods or in \"progress payment\" form.\nUp to 80% of the manufacturer's costs can be paid prior to delivery in progress payments,\nwith the remaining paid 30 days after receipt of invoice.\n- Firm Fixed Price (FFP)--The price is fixed regardless of actual cost.\n\n- Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPI)(F)--The price is adjusted based on actual cost and use\nof a share ratio.\nAward Fee. An award fee contract is unilaterally determined by the government based on\nits subjective evaluation of contract performance.\n- Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)--This is a stand alone contract.\n- Combination--in combination with fixed or cost contract types.\nThe contract let by ASG to AEG for the production of CNI modules is of the Firm Fixed\nPrice Type.\n3.3.6.3 Pricing\nPricing of Non-Commercial Items. The pricing of military contracts is unique given the\nmonopsonistic market structure, government control, quasi-competitive market, and the\nexpense of funds from taxpayers wallets.\nFigure 3.2 Components of Defense Contracting Cost\nContract Price =\nCost\n+\nProfit/Fee\nMaterial Handling\nOverhead\nManufacturing Support\nEngineering Support\nGeneral & Admin.\nFCCM\nIndirect\nCost =\n+\nDirect Labor\nEngineering Labor\nManufacturing Labor\nOther Direct Costs\nDirect Cost\nRaw Material\nPurchased Parts\nDirect Material\nSubcontracts\nStd Commercial Items\nInter-divisional Transfers\n(DoD, 1998)\n\nThis is one of the areas where the combination of government regulations and monopsony\npower are exerted. Since a truly competitive market is non-existent, leading to the potential\nof excess rents, the buyer uses its power to expose the cost structure of the defense\ncontractor and to impose a fixed profit or fee rate. In other words, the government relies on\ncost data to negotiate a fair and reasonable price in its mission to protect the public trust.\nThe pricing equation and the components of cost are shown in Figure 3.2.\nPricing of \"Commercial Items\". The pricing of what are defined as \"commercial items\" is\ndone differently than non-commercial items (see Appendix A for a detailed definition of\nCommercial Items). Changes brought about by FASA and FARA allow the DoD to\npurchase commercial items as a commercial firm would. The determination of the price of a\ncommercial item entails: 1) determining if the item does in fact meet the definition of a\ncommercial item, 2) determination of a fair and reasonable price for the item through market\nresearch.\n3.3.6.4 Cost Accounting Standards\nGiven the emphasis on cost as a method of pricing control and oversight, the DoD requires\nthat contractors meet specific Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Specifically, the CAS\nwere developed to ensure proper cost allocation and as a standard method for cost\ncomparisons between contractors. A CAS-compliant accounting system is required by the\nDoD for compliance with this standard. The CAS accounting system is established to track\nlabor hours and materials during manufacture, so that \"progress payments\" can be made at\nspecific milestones in the program. Contracts are written such that the buyer owns the labor\nand materials throughout the process. The \"progress payment\" method of program\nfinancing requires a CAS-compliant system (DoD, 1998).\nThe CAS require that costs be broken down by individual contract. For example, an\nengineer or scientist working on multiple projects, associated with multiple contracts, is\nrequired to account for individual labor hours by contract number for all work performed.\n3.3.6.5 Supplier Selection\nASD selects suppliers based on two fundamentals of the defense business. First, whether\nthe supplier has proven the capability of delivering components approved to military\nspecifications and secondly, whether the supplier operates according to military standards\nand practices. The selection process places nearly complete reliance on the military\nspecifications and standards system. Past performance is just beginning to play a role in\n\nthe selection process, however minor, particularly when a lack of competition for a given\nkey component exists.\n3.4 Commercial Industry Practices at TRW AEG\nThis section discusses commercial industry practices at TRW AEG, based on a site visit\nand tour (Groth, 1998) of the production facility in Marshall, Illinois, and based on seven\nyears experience as an engineer and project manager at an automotive OEM.\n3.4.1 Culture\nThe culture at AEG is typical of a commercial enterprise operating in a highly competitive\nmarket and can be characterized by the following:\n-\nA focus on understanding customer needs\n- A focus on best value; minimizing cost while achieving performance targets.\n- A culture where successful risk taking is rewarded.\n- A culture with focus on manufacturing efficiency and optimization.\n-\nA focus on profit maximization for the firm.\n3.4.2 Sources of New Business Opportunities\nHow does a \"commercial\" supplier find business? In the automotive industry, a few\nmethods are used. One method is essentially a request for proposals (RFP) bidding\nprocess, where OEM buyers of automotive components or sub-systems send a packet of\ninformation to known sources capable of producing the assembly. The list of known\nsources comes from lists of current suppliers, industry supplier listings, and sales literature\nsent to the OEM from suppliers. The packet of information usually includes all the material\nnecessary to make a per unit price bid for a stated delivery schedule. Bid packets typically\ninclude disguised drawings, specification documents, and delivery schedule requirements.\nThis method is used for purchasing commodity products and for beginning long-term\nrelationships as described next.\nA second method is limited to the suppliers with the most direct interaction with the OEM\nand who have had successful long-term relationships. In this case, the supplier would\nwork with the OEM to develop a new or improved product, incorporating the supplier's\n\nknowledge of process capability and technology advances. The close relationships can\npotentially yield a superior design in a shorter design cycle.\nA third method is for a supplier to develop a new product or technology and \"shop\naround\" for an OEM application. An example in the context of TRW AEG might be a new\nsafety system sensor technology that was developed in-house, without a specific customer\nin mind but with an understanding of market needs.\n3.4.3 Business Practices\n3.4.3.1 Quality Systems\nThe quality systems in place at TRW AEG are automotive industry accepted practices, and\nare internally referred to as the TRW Quality System. This quality system meets the intent\nof the international quality system known as ISO 9000. The International Organization for\nStandards (ISO) quality system ISO 9000 is a methodology for an organization to operate\nwithin, leading towards the improvement of or sustainment of high quality products. The\nframework of ISO 9000 is truly a system. It includes all aspects of the product value\nchain, from management philosophy to continuous process improvement (IBP BP IPT,\n1995).\nThe elements of ISO 9000 include the following areas:\n- Management Responsibility\n- Inspection and Testing\n- Quality System\n- Control of Inspection, Measuring, and\n- Contract Management\nTest Equipment\n- Design Control\n- Inspection and Testing\n- Document and Data Control\n- Control of Non-conforming Product\n- Purchasing\n- Corrective and Preventive Action\nStorage,\nPackaging,\n- Control of Customer-Supplier Product\n- Handling,\nPreservation and Delivery\n- Product Identification and Traceablity\n- Control of Quality Records\n- Process Control\n- Training\n\n3.4.3.2 Parts Control, Selection, and Workmanship Standards\nIn the high volume world of the automotive industry, parts inspection, rework, and scrap\nbecome very costly to not only the supplier but also the customer. To combat these costs\nand to continuously improve the quality of production, statistical methods have been\ndeveloped, commonly referred to as statistical process control, and are described below.\nStatistical Process Control (SPC). In general, a process in statistical control can be\ndescribed by a predictable distribution, from which the proportion of in-specification parts\ncan be estimated. As long as the process remains in statistical control and does not undergo\na change in location, spread, or shape, it will continue to produce the same distribution of\nin-specification parts. Process capability is determined by the variation that comes from\ncommon causes. Common causes are defined as the many sources of variation that have\nstable and repeatable distribution over time. In fact, if only common causes were present\nand did not change, the output of the process would be predictable. If the process\ncapability for a given operation falls within the specified upper and lower bounds of the\nrequirements, then the process is same to be capable. (AIAG, 1991)\nProduction Part Approval Process. The purpose of the Production Part Approval Process\n(PPAP) is to determine if all customer engineering design and specification requirements\nare correctly understood by the supplier and that the production process has the potential to\nproduce product which meets these requirements during an actual production at the quoted\nproduction rate. Production parts are manufactured at the production site using the\nproduction tooling, gauging, process, materials, operators, environment, and process\nsettings.\nParts submitted for PPAP must be taken from a \"significant\" production run. A\n\"significant\" production run would typically be from one hour to one shift's production,\nwith the production quantity for submission to total 300 consecutive parts minimum, unless\nsome other quantity has been agreed upon (i.e.; very low volume part or process produces\nmany more than 300 in one hour or shift). Parts for each position of a multiple cavity\nmold, die, tool or pattern are to be measured and representative parts tested (AIAG, 1995).\nOnce the 300 part PPAP samples are produced, all customer dimensional, material, and\nperformance requirements are tested or measured to demonstrate initial process capability.\nThese requirements are evaluated on various sub-sets of the sample submission parts,\nusually on a 25-50 piece sample from at least 10 subgroups.\n\n3.4.4 Product Design and Development\n3.4.4.1 Product Design\nThe components and processes used in the design of automotive electronics follow the\nphilosophy of low cost with best value performance. The typical use of components\ninclude a few ASICS of low complexity, low to high PCB component density, extensive\nuse of analog circuitry, some RF circuitry, and very little digital. ASICS are \"packaged\" in\nplastic, which is inexpensive and meets the environmental conditions required for\nautomobiles. A focus on efficient manufacturing is an important method for reducing\nproduct cost. DFM analysis is given a great deal of attention. If a manufacturing problem\narises due to product design, the burden of change usually falls on the side of a design\nchange, since efficient manufacturing is so essential (IBP PT IPT, 1995).\nThe standard method for attaching electrical components to the PCB assemblies at TRW\nAEG, is with through-hole mounting. This method is common and has been used for\nmany years. The process begins with a PCB that is etched with the circuits and with holes\nthrough the board in the locations of component leads. Components are placed on the PCB\nwith automated assembly equipment, such that the leads of the chip are placed through the\nPCB holes (an chip may have 20+ leads per side). The assembly is then processes through\na soldering process called \"wave flow\" soldering, where the PCB and components are\npassed over a wave of molten solder such that the wave only contacts the component leads\nprotruding through the PCB. The solder is wicked up the leads and affixes the components\nto the PCB.\nSurface mount designs, as used extensively in the defense industry and described in the last\nsection, are also employed in commercial industry but to a lesser extent in automotive\napplications.\n3.4.4.2 Design Specifications\nDesign specifications for commercial products are stated in any of a number of ways.\nIndustry organizations such as SAE, ANSI, and ISO are just a few. SAE specifications are\nknown to many consumers, particularly the engine oil specifications like 10W50 or 5W30.\nThe commercial firm can also create its own test specifications for custom designed\n\nproducts. These specifications are typically performance driven or \"must meet this\" in\nnature.\n3.4.4.3 Design Validation and Testing\nDesign validation and testing are taken very seriously at AEG, especially since many of the\nproducts, such as restraint system electronic controls, are safety related and involve product\nliability risk. Since per unit costs are relatively small, many components and assemblies\nare tested to validate not only the design, but also the design as produced by the\nmanufacturing process. With very high production volumes, the number of defective\nproducts produced at a given probability are increased, driving the necessity for a very\nrobust design and manufacturing process. This high production volume leads to the\nnecessity of large test sample lot sizes to prove statistical confidence in the design and\nprocess (Murphy, 1996). Testing is done for functionality, environmental conditions,\nthermal shock/vibration, dust and humidity. The limited use of computer simulation\nmodeling to test designs is being increased, however no thermal simulations are performed.\n3.4.5 Manufacturing\nTRW AEG manufactures electronic assemblies for 14 customers from a single facility in\nMarshall, Illinois. This facility contains 6 production lines that are designed for the flexible\nmanufacture of PCB assemblies. Five of these lines are for the very high volume products,\nwhile the sixth line, known as Flex Line 3, is designed for lower volume products.\nAlthough the five high volume lines are similar, each has some unique equipment for the\nproduction of specific assemblies, such as airbag sensor assemblies. The manufacturing\nenvironment at AEG and can be characterized by the following (Groth, 1998):\n- High volume/high mix\n- Central facility for scale economies in labor and overhead\n-\nHighly automated\n-\nContinuous flow production\n- Automated production line material replenishment\n-\nProduct change-over is done infrequently, striving for a high utilization rate.\n- Striving for maximum utilization of capital equipment\n-\nCapital intensive operation\n\nProduction testing includes 100% checking for defects and burn-in, and a statistical\nsampling for environmental and functional tests.\n3.4.6 Business Agreements\n3.4.6.1 Contract Regulations\nTypical commercial business contracts vary from industry to industry and are tailored to the\nspecific set of circumstances and issues involved in the particular business arrangement. In\ngeneral, commercial contracts stick to the basics of price, delivery, quality, and service\nexpectations. The length of contracts vary, however long-term contracts with proven\nsuppliers are beneficial to both parties, particularly with regard to resource planning and\ndevelopment of good relationships.\n3.4.6.2 Pricing\nThe pricing of commercial products varies based on whether it is a commodity item, an off\nthe shelf item, or a designed to specification item. Also considered in pricing is the level of\nservice being provide with the purchase in the way of engineering support, delivery, and\nwarranties.\nCompetitive Market\nCommodity and homogenous products. These types of products have prices established\nthrough competitive markets (Pindyck, 1995). Market prices are easily obtained from sales\nliterature, catalogs and price lists. If large quantities are being procured, reduced prices can\nusually be negotiated through the requesting of quotes from a number of sources.\nDesign to specification product. In a market where a number of competitive suppliers are\ncapable of producing a product, the buyer can \"shop around\" the specifications of a new\nproduct and a target price until a supplier is willing to meet the requirements.\nUncompetitive Market\nMonopoly supplier of a product or technology. In this situation the supplier holds market\npower and can set the price where it deems appropriate (Pindyck, 1995). The buyer must\ndetermine whether the price is reasonable based on the need for the specific product or\ntechnology.\n\nCurrent successful long-term relationship.\nA successful long-term relationship is one\nwhere the expectations of the OEM are met and a mutually beneficial environment of trust\nand sharing is present. Open relationships such as this ensure a high level of commitment\non the part of both parties in all areas of the business, from leadership to engineering and\nmanufacturing. This does not mean that quality or production problems do not arise on\noccasion. However when they do, the supplier acts quickly to announce the problem and\nthe supplier-buyer \"team\" work together to solve the problem quickly and to make\nadjustments accordingly.\nIn this case, the supplier holds market power due to the beneficial relationship between it\nand the buyer. This relationship has been developed over many years and both parties are\nhappy. In this case pricing of designed-to-specification products are negotiated in an open\nenvironment of trust and mutual respect for the relationship. The price may or may not be\nhigher than is available elsewhere, however the value of the relationship and the switching\ncosts are difficult to determine and are risky.\n3.4.6.3 Accounting\nCommercial firms account for product costs as they see fit within the guidelines of\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and tax laws. The components of cost,\nsuch as labor and materials, are held closely so that information about the firms competitive\nposition and profit margins are not exposed to competitors. All costs of goods sold\n(COGS), including capital depreciation, are owned by the firm until the finished product is\nsold.\n3.4.6.3 Supplier Selection\nCommercial firms select suppliers based on many attributes.\nIn sum, the favorable\nattributes are those that support the buyer's needs (cost, quality, deliver, technology,\nperformance, engineering support, etc.) and indicate a good chance of a long-term mutually\nbeneficial relationship. Figure 3.3 lists the comprehensive supplier selection evaluation\ncategories for an automotive OEM. Each category is evaluated by the supplier selection\nteam and given a numerical rating. The category scores are then multiplied by a weighting\nfactor for relative importance and then tallied for comparison versus other potential sources.\n\nFigure 3.3 Sourcing Evaluation Categories at an Automotive OEM\nBusiness Factors:\n-\nExperience\n-\nTraining Programs\n-\nTeam Concept\n-\nProven Performance\n-\nLocation: U.S. vs. Int'l\n-\nHousekeeping\n-\nCost Competitiveness\n-\nContinuous Improvement\n-\nInnovativeness\n-\nPresent Customers\n-\nStability\n-\nFinancial Strength\n-\nProprietary Products\n-\nOpenness\n-\nRisk/Reward\nEngineering Issues:\n-\nFlexibility/responsiveness\n-\nJust-in-Time Systems\n-\nProcess Certification\n-\nResearch and Development\n-\nTest & Validation\n-\nCapability\n-\nQuality Control System\nCapability\n-\nReliability History\n-\nSub-supplier Relationships\n-\nTechnology\n-\nCapacity\n-\nDesign (DFM/DFA)\nManagement Philosophies:\n-\nAttitude\n-\nPeople Orientation\n-\nCooperativeness\n-\nStyle\n-\nLabor Relations History\n-\nSuggestion Plan\n-\nCustomer Orientation\n-\nEmpowerment\n(Source: OEM Supplier Selection Manual)\n3.5 Integration of Defense and Commercial Business\nGiven the very different environments in each of the business sectors that the TRW\ndivisions operate, the challenge was to integrate them in a manor that was functionally\nacceptable to AEG and legally acceptable to the military customer. Since one focus of\nmilitary-commercial integration is on bringing performance-based business practices into\nthe defense sector, the foundation of the IBP was to not force changes onto the commercial\nAEG organization, but instead to infuse commercial practices into the ASG organization.\nThe challenges facing military-commercial integration are many. This section will review\nthe challenges and barriers which the MPCL program encountered, and the solutions they\nfound for overcoming them.\n3.5.1 Comparison of Defense and Commercial Industry Practices\nLet us begin by comparing side-by-side the TRW ASD \"defense\" and TRW AEG\n\"commercial\" practices. Figure 3.4 summarizes the discussion of the last two sections on\nthe industry practices of the defense and commercial business sectors.\n\nFigure 3.4 Summary Comparison of Defense and Commercial Practices\nDefense Industry\nCommercial Industry\nat TRW ASG\nCulture\n-\nBureaucratic and process driven\n-\nRisk averse\n-\n\"How to\"\n-\nCommon sense practices\n-\nAdaptive and flexible\n-\n\"Meet this\"\n-\nPerformance over cost\n-\nBest value\nSources of New\n-\nBuyer announcement\n-\nRFP from OEM\nBusiness\n-\nCommerce Business Daily\n-\nContinuation of current\nOpportunities\nadvertisement\nrelationship\n-\nBusiness Practices\nQuality Systems\n-\nMil-Q-9858A\n(recently obsoleted for ISO)\n-\nISO 9000 equivalent\nParts Control &\n-\nMil-Std-965\n-\nUse of SPC\nWorkmanship Standards\n-\nMil-Std-2000A\n-\nPPAP\nProduct Design\nMaterial Specifications\n-\nMilitary spec's and stds.\n(recently replaced)\n-\nIndustry spec's and stds.\nComponents\n-\nDesign and materials for\noperation at extreme\n-\nDesign and materials for\noperation in less extreme\ntemperatures\n-\nCeramic ASIC packages that are\nvacuum sealed.\ntemperatures\n-\nPlastic ASIC packages\nTesting & Validation\n-\nTests are minimized, using as\nfew components and assemblies\nas feasible\n-\nNumerous test using many\ncomponents and assemblies\nManufacturing\n-\nLow volume/high mix\n-\nHigh volume/low mix\n-\nLow capital investment\n-\nCapital intensive\n-\nManual assembly\n-\nHighly automated assembly\nBusiness Agreements\nContracting\n-\nNumerous BP&P requirements\nand contractual clauses\n-\nCommon sense practices\n-\nIncentives for cost reduction and\nquality improvements\nPricing\n-\nCost driven with fixed profit/fee\nrate\n-\nCompetitive market driven\nCost Accounting\n-\nCAS compliant accounting\nsystem is required\n-\nCustomer requirement to track\ncosts in particular manor\n-\nMust meet GAAP/Tax rules for\nreporting purposes\n-\nNot a customer requirement\nSupplier Selection\n-\nBased on ability to meet military\nspecifications and standards\n-\nBased on past performance, good\nrelationships, support and cost.\nat TRW AEG\n\"Shop around\" new technology\n\n3.5.2 Cultural Integration\nGiven the extreme cultural differences between the defense and commercial industries, it\nshould be expected that integration will be difficult. The IBP program confronted this\nchallenge through implementing a training plan. The training plan goals were to establish a\nstrong team environment for the creation of the three program IPTs, develop a common\nunderstanding of current engineering and infrastructure improvements, and to familiarize\nparticipants with the tools used in the concurrent engineering environment. Through team\ntraining and team building, participants in the IBP from both ASD and AEG were aligned\nwith a common understanding of program goals and were able to bring the unique skills of\neach industry to the table.\n3.5.3 Sources of New Business Opportunities\nIt is apparent from the comparison of defense and commercial industry sources of new\nbusiness opportunities that each looks to different sources.\nFor military-commercial\nintegration to take place, these sources must be aligned. The MPCL program did not,\nhowever, encounter a barrier in this area since the program was created on the basis of\nselecting AEG for production of the CNI modules. Essentially the source of new business\nfor AEG was the relationship with ASD through the parent TRW corporation. This\nrelationship is similar to the non-competitive selection of a supplier with good long-term\nrelations.\n3.5.4 Business Practice Integration\n3.5.4.1 Quality Systems\nThe BP&P IPT made a detailed comparison of the TRW Quality System against ISO 9001\nstandards, which are in agreement with Mil-Q-9858A. The comparison found the Quality\nSystem to be in agreement with exceptions in these areas:\nCosts Related to Quality (Mil-Q-9858A, Par. 3.6) There is no ISO series equivalent clause for\nthis item. TRW AEG tracks cost related operational metrics such as scrap, rework, first\npass success rate, and loss of production, for daily management information purposes. It\n\nis common industry practice for customers to request a review of this data, however no\nformal reporting is provided which would increase the costs of the QA system.\nUse of Contractor's Inspection Equipment by Government Personnel (Mil-Q-9858A, Par. 4.4)\nThere is no ISO series or TRW QS equivalent clause for this item. Given the statistical\nquality control at the AEG facility, no special equipment needs are foreseen.\nGovernment Inspection at Subcontractors (Mil-Q-9858A, Par. 7.1) There is no ISO series or\nTRW QS equivalent clause for this item. The government reserves the right to make\nquality inspection of production items at the source, which is disruptive to the\nmanufacturing process. The most similar ISO 9001 statement (Par. 4.6.4) affords \"the\nright to verify at the subcontractors premises.\" It is common in the automotive industry for\ncustomer representatives to visit the production facilities and discuss quality, design, and\ncost reduction programs, and to offer assistance in approval of such programs. It is not,\nhowever, acceptable for the customer to disrupt production at the source for quality\ninspections, unless there have been specific qualify problems with delivered goods which\nhave affected the customers business. Even in this case, the customer and supplier would\nclosely together and are in acceptance of the situation as a necessary means to a solution.\nThe cost of quality at the military and commercial businesses of TRW are compared in\nFigure 3.5 versus a typical small business. These costs of quality include internal failure\ncosts, appraisal costs, and prevention costs. External failure costs do not appear to be\nincluded in this comparison. It can be seen that the cost of quality at AEG is 40% below\nthat of ASD, and well below the 1-2% that the BP IPT perceives to be standard for a small\nbusiness. This difference in appraisal costs is a function of the high volume sales of AEG\nwith low personnel for quality control, along with the use of statistical process control\nmethods.\nFigure 3.5 Cost of Quality Comparison\nCost of Quality as\nPercentage of Sales\nSmall Business\n1-2.%\nTRW \"Military\" ASD\n0.57%\n0.32%\nTRW \"Commercial\" AEG\n(Source: IBP BP IPT, 1995)\n\n3.5.4.2 Parts Control and Selection\nThe BP&P IPT made a cost comparison of the military standard versus the internal\ncommercial parts control and selection processes of TRW AEG. This comparison showed\nthat a significant reduction (>30%) in parts approval cycle-time can be achieved using the\ncommercial practices. Figure 3.6 shows the comparison data.\n3.5.4.3 Workmanship Standards Integration\nThe military\nstandard Mil-Std-2000A is not acceptable to TRW AEG due to its\nrequirements for in-process inspections by personnel.\nAn analysis of alternative\nworkmanship standards was performed and generated the commercial alternatives of\nANSI/J-003 and IPC-610. Both of these standards are similar to Mil-Std-2000 in technical\nrequirements for component mounting, soldering, and defect tables, however they differ\nwith respect to inspection methodology (100% inspection versus SPC), customer audits,\nand training programs.\nFigure 3.6 Parts Approval Time Comparison in Days\nASD\n\"Military\"\nAEG\n\"Commercial\"\nPart/Process Approval (PPAP)\nEvaluate Existing Part Data\nGenerate NSPAR\nContract or Part Approval\nParts Control Board Approval\nSupplier Survey\nTotal\n192 days\n135 days\n(Source: IBP BP IPT, 1995)\nA test was performed to compare the costs incurred through each of these standards. The\ntest subject was an AEG produced engine controller for Caterpillar, which was subjected to\nthe military inspection process and a cost comparison was made between it and the\ncommercial process costs. It was determined that the military inspection costs are at least\nfour times those incurred by commercial practices.\nIt was also determined that the\nadditional inspection steps required of the military standard do not add value to the product,\n\nand therefore should be eliminated. As a result, a recommendation to flow down the\nANSI/J-003 class III commercial workmanship standards was made.\n3.5.5 Product Design and Development Integration\n3.5.5.1 Product Design\nA summary of design and process characteristics is shown below in Figure 3.7. In the area\nof product design, the MPCL program sought to reduce costs and improve quality through\nthe use of IPTs, commercial components, and commercial processes. To achieve these\ngoals a number of actions were taken, including the implementation of a Concurrent\nEngineering Environment and the evaluation of commercial electronics components versus\na rationalized military system performance envelope.\nConcurrent Engineering Environment (CEE). The starting point for developing a CEE for\nthe IBP was to evaluate the current CEE at both ASD and AEG. A comparison of the\nproduct design and process characteristics of each division is given below in Figure 3.6.\nAccording to the CEE Definition document, the implemented environment must provide\nthe following to meet IBP program objectives:\n- Provide a development environment which allows the use of concurrent\nengineering principles for a seamless product transition to manufacturing\nresulting in minimum design modifications.\n- Allow cost effective geographic distribution of product development and\nmanufacturing data through the use of EDI.\n- Implement a manufacturing infrastructure using agile or flexible lines for the\nmanufacture of small quantities of military electronic modules.\n- Allow transition of the IBP CEE architecture and methodologies to industry\nthrough the use of standards, open systems, and metrics.\n\nFigure 3.7 Detailed Comparison of Product Design Characteristics\nASD--Defense\nDesign Elements\ngrowing portion of digital circuitry\nDesign Complexity\nPCB:\nHigh Density\nPCB:\nLow to High Density\nASICS: Highly Complex\nASICS: Low Complexity\nCAD Tools\nStandardized on Mentor Graphics,\nalso use third party integrated tools\nViewlogic/Recal-Redac\nDesign Validation\nExtensive use of simulation\nmodeling\nSmall but growing use of simulation\nmodeling\nDoD releases liability from ASG\nfor field failures\nLiable for product field failures.\nDevelopment Process\nProduction units modified with\nMultiple cycles of pre-production\nprototypes\njumpers).\nProduction Volume\nLow Volume, 50 - 500 units total\nHigh Volume, >50,000 units/yr.\nper product\nProduction Process\nHigh level of manual labor, not\nContinuous flow, High levels of\nautomation\nFunctional and\nAll manufactured modules\nStatistical sampling of manufactured\nEnvironmental Testing\nmodules\nAEG--Commercial\nSignificant digital logic with some\nMostly analog and RF devices with\nanalog and RF devices\nIn transition from PCAD to\ndesign modifications (cuts and\ncontinuous flow, no CIM\n(Source: IBP MI IPT,1995)\nCommercial Component Evaluation. In order to utilize commercial electronic components\nand the advantages of them (reduced costs, current AEG supplier network, etc.) their\nperformance must be evaluated relative to the operating requirements of the CNI modules.\nThis was done in a number of steps. First, numerous commercial PCB and plastic\npackaged chips were tested to confirm the operating limits as specified by the manufacturer.\nSecondly, the CNI module operating environment limits were rationalized for the modules\nthemselves, versus for the F-22 aircraft as a whole (Myers, 1998). The rationalized\noperating limits were then compared against the component test results, demonstrating that\ncommercially available components and plastic packaging were viable for the military\napplication. Finally, the custom military ASICS were redesigned with commercial plastic\npackages to reduce costs. This evaluation process lead to the decision to utilize plastic\npackages (IBP PT IPT, 1995).\n\n3.5.5.2 Specifications\nComponent specifications for design such as materials, were stated in the industry standard\npractices of AEG. Since the AEG suppliers of commercial electronic components were the\nsources to be utilized for the program, they are accustomed to the use of these standards.\nAdditionally, specifications and standards reform policy direct the use of non-military\nstandard whenever possible.\nThe only \"military\" specified components were the interfacing components, such as\nconnectors, which connect the electronics modules with the aircraft and were system\nspecified by the prime contractor. In this case, the supplier was not a current supplier to\nAEG, but was a supplier to ASG for the same components as used in other modules not\nincluded in the MPCL program. As a result, ASG supplied the connectors to AEG, leading\nto the avoidance of complexity in specifications flowdown.\n3.5.5.3 Product Validation and Testing\nThe integration of product validation and testing was straightforward. Since the assemblies\nare low volume and costly, testing resembled the defense industry methods of small test\nsample sizes and extensive use of computer simulation modeling. The exception was the\ntesting of the commercial components to the operating limits, where large samples could be\nevaluated cost effectively.\n3.5.6 Manufacturing Integration\nThe manufacture of the low volume military electronics modules on the high volume\ncommercial manufacturing line at AEG requires that the manufacturing facility be capable of\nproducing the design in the volumes required. The design for manufacturing concerns now\nhave a concurrent engineering environment for evaluation and redesign as discussed in the\nlast section, which identified the need for additional processing capabilities. The question\nof volume capability rests on the state of the manufacturing infrastructure and the use of\ncomputer integrated manufacturing.\n3.5.6.1 Processing Capabilities.\nThe processing capabilities at the AEG facility required a few improvements and additions\nfor the manufacture of the CNI modules. These modifications included:\n- Screen Printer--the existing screen printer at AEG was not capable of screening the\nhigh density and fine pitch leads required by the complex military ASICS. As a\n\nresult, this equipment was replaced with a new screen printer capable of this\nrequirement.\n- Manual Assembly Area--An area with work stations was installed for the assembly\nof components to the modules which require manual operations. Core bonding is\none process which will be done in this area as is the placement of components\nwhich exceed the physical size constraints of the placement equipment.\n- BGA Removal/Repair--Equipment was installed in the manual assembly area for the\nremoval of BGA components to repair connections that process tests had shown as\nnon-performing.\nModifications to the AEG assembly line totaled $392,000 in capital equipment, which\nrepresents less than 5% of the $8,552,000 total capital invested in the production line (IBP\nBP IPT, 1997).\n3.5.6.2 Computer Integrated Manufacturing\nThe purpose of the Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) system is to facilitate the\nflexible manufacture of low volume/high mix military electronics modules with the high\nvolume/low mix AEG production environment in Marshall, Illinois. The current design to\nmanufacture systems in place at AEG require a large effort and are therefore very costly\nwhen introducing new products. This high cost makes it even more difficult to introduce\nlow volume products such as the military CNI electronic modules. Automation of the\ndesign to production system will reduce the cost and effort required to introduce new\nproducts, from design to initial production. Design to production processes can be\nmodified by CIM in the areas of product data management, program development,\nautomated database configuration, user interface development, and data entry into the MRP\nsystem.\nThe CIM system will offer many outputs which will dramatically improve the ability to\nmanage the manufacturing process and for implementing continuous improvements.\nFigure 3.8 lists the many CIM system outputs. The testing of production assemblies is\nplanned to resemble the automotive methods of statistical sampling versus the 100% testing\nof the defense industry. However, given the small production runs, there will be difficulty\nin developing high statistical confidence .\n\nFigure 3.8 Computer Integrated Manufacturing System Outputs\nProduct Performance and History Functions\n-\nMaterial and Process Traceability\n-\nAutomatic Reporting of Scrap\n-\nElectronic Scheduling\n-\nOperator Reporting of Scrap\n-\nWarnings for Schedule Problems\n-\nSetup and Cycle Time Feedback\n-\nWork In Process (WIP) Tracking\n-\nSetup Verification-Material\n-\nModule History Review\n-\nMaintenance Management System Interface\n-\nControlled Replenishment of Line Side Storage\nMistake Proofing\n-\nProcess mistake proofing\n-\nReal time feedback\n-\nPrior step mistake proofing\n-\nSupplier Feedback\nProblem Solving Tools\n-\nGraphs and reports\n-\nOn-line quality assurance manual\n-\nSymptoms and solutions history\n-\nQueries\n(Source:IBP MI IPT, 1995)\n3.5.7 Business Arrangement Integration\n3.5.7.1 Contracting Integration\nTRW AEG was adamantly opposed to any contractual obligations which are outside of the\nrealm of standard commercial practices before the MPCL IBP, and remains opposed today.\nThis position is grounded on the basis of:\n- Cost--associated with compliance.\n- Disruption--of normal business and production.\n- Risk--exposure of proprietary information and potential leaks to competitors.\nRemoval of clauses from the subcontract would be challenging, if not impossible, prior to\nthe determination of Commercial Item status for the IBP modules. Prior to Commercial\nItem determination 30 clauses were applicable to the AEG subcontract, while only 3\nclauses were applicable after Commercial Item status was determined. Figure 3.9 list the\nclauses before and after Commercial Item determination.\n\nFigure 3.9 Contractual Clauses Before and After Commercial Item Status\nDate\nClause Title\nBefore Commercial Item Status:\nAnti-Kickback Procedures\nDefense Priority and Allocation Requirements (DPAS)\nExamination of Records by Comptroller General\nAudit-Negotiation\nSubcontractor Cost or Pricing Data\nTermination of Defined Benefits Pension Plan\nRevision or Adjustment of Plans for Post Retirement Benefits Other than Pensions\nUtilization of Labor Surplus Area Concerns\nLabor Surplus Area Subcontracting Program\nNotice to the Government of labor Disputes\nWalsh-Healey Public Contracts Act\nEqual Opportunity Employment\nAffirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans\nAffirmative Action for Handicapped Workers\nEmployment Records on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam\nEra\nClean Air and Water Act\nRestrictions on Foreign Purchases\nAuthorization and Consent\nNotice and Assistance Regarding Patent and Copyright Infringement\nChanges-Fixed Price\nLimitation of Liability\nAcquisition form Subcontractors Subject to On-site Inspection Under the\nIntermediate-range Nuclear Treaty\nDuty Free Entry--Qualifying Country End Products and Supplies\nPreference for Domestic Specialty Metals\nForeign Source Restrictions\nRights in Technical Data and Computer Software\nRestrictive Markings on Technical Data\nAfter Commercial Item Status:\nEqual Opportunity Employment\nAffirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans\nAffirmative Action for Handicapped Workers\nSpecial Prohibition on Employment\nIdentification of Technical Data\nStatutory Prohibition on Compensation to Former DoD Employees\n(Source: IBP BP IPT, 1997)\n\nThe culmination of the IBP work in the area of contracting and business practices has been\nthe development of a manual titled \"Business Practice Requirements for Defense\nSuppliers.\" This reference source presents suggested methods and best practices for\nimplementing supply chain integration. The IBP benchmarked and reviewed commercial\nindustry and defense industry contracting methods. A comparison of the operational\nrequirement totals for each are shown in Figure 3.10 along with a breakdown of the 78\npossible IBP requirements.\nFigure 3.10 Operational Requirement Comparison\nBenchmark/Source\nTotal Requirements\nAutomotive Industry QS9000\nF-22 EMD\nANSI Q9001\nMPCL IBP\nQ9001 Basic Requirements\nQ9001 Clarified for Defense\nNational Standards\nMilitary Standards\nBest Practices\nIBP Total\n(Source: IBP BP IPT, 1997)\nThe justification for Commercial Item determination on the CNI electronics modules were\nas follows (Dillon, 1997):\n- AEG only performed work for non-government customers.\n- AEG products are \"of a type\" used for non-government purposes.\n- The CNI modules would be produced using the same processes , equipment,\nand workforce that are used for commercial products sold to the general public.\n3.5.7.2 Pricing\nOnce Commercial Item status was determined, pricing considerations moved away from the\ntypical defense industry focus on obtaining cost information and towards determining a fair\nmarket value for the modules.\nMarket research and Pricing Analysis. Determination of price reasonableness through\nmarket research requires that equivalent or similar products be available for price\ncomparison. This is not the case with custom designed products which are not widely\nused. The IBP was able to compare the modules against commercially available digital\n\nsignal processors and the prices for components utilized in them. This analysis showed\nthat the PNP price was approximately 3% below the market price of comparable products,\nwhile the RF/FEC price was approximately 10% below the market price (IBP BP IPT,\n1997).\nAEG Determination of Price. TRW AEG used their proprietary financial analysis model for\ncalculation of a price for the CNI modules. This financial model takes the inputs of\nvolume, limited non-recurring engineering costs, capital requirements, material cost, labor\ncosts, and a fixed target for return on assets employed (ROAE) to determine a per unit\nprice. This price can then be compared against ASG's design-to-cost price target to see if\na business case for proceeding with the program is viable. The model assumed a multi\nyear procurement of modules over several years. (Ebeling, 1996)\nThe Firm Fixed Price Commercial Item Subcontract between ASD and AEG was written\nwith the prices of $11,800 each for 41 units of FR/FEC modules and $16,525 each for 75\nunits of PNP modules, for delivery on June 1, 1998 (IBP BP IPT, 1997).\n3.5.7.3 Accounting Standards\nThe determination that the IBP electronic modules were \"commercial items\" relieved AEG\nof the need for a CAS-compliant accounting system.\n3.5.7.4 Supplier Selection\nThe selection of suppliers for the IBP program were in concert with minimizing the\ndisruption of the AEG's business practices. Components were sourced differently by type\nas described below.\n- Commercial Components--Current suppliers of commercial components to AEG were\nused in all possible cases to take advantage of current relationships, scale purchases,\nand current administrative processes.\n- Custom ASIC and MCM Redesigns--The redesign of the custom CNI ASIC's and\nMCM's were sourced to new suppliers for AEG. This was because no current AEG\nsuppliers were able to supply the components.\n- Standard Electronic Module Interfacing--The SEM interfacing components for the CNI\nelectronics suite are common across the F-22 and RAH-66 platforms.\nSince the\ncomponents are currently being supplied to ASD to military specification, the easiest\nsolution for the IBP was for ASD to supplier the components to AEG through its own\nprocurement system.\n\n3.6 Supply Chain Integration\nSupply chain integration is a major enabler for the success of the MPCL IBP program. The\nIBP team saw supply chain integration as a necessity for obtaining the greatest possible\ngains from military-commercial integration.\nThe potential benefits of supply chain\nintegration include:\n- Improved product design--through accurate, efficient, and open dialogue in a team\nenvironment, throughout the product design and development process.\n- Faster design cycle--through efficient communication, open discussion to avoid\ndesign delays, and fast team reaction to development roadblocks.\n- Higher quality products--improved designs yield high quality products.\n- Reduced costs--faster design cycles, higher quality products, and more efficient\ndesigns lead to reduced product costs.\n- Win-Win outcomes--relationships with open communication and trust provide all\nparticipants with a \"win.\"\nThe MPCL IBP program sought to implement supply chain integration through the\ndevelopment of a concurrent engineering environment (CEE) for design activities, and\nthrough computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) for manufacturing activities. The extent\nof supply chain integration for the CNI electronics modules was limited to the integration of\nactivities at ASD as the system supplier and AEG as the module manufacturer. Linkages\nbetween component suppliers and AEG appear to be limited to those component suppliers\nwhich provide AEG with material for other production programs, while the suppliers of\nmilitary-unique components do not appear to be linked.\n3.6.1 Concurrent Engineering Environment\nThe distributed integrated product team (IPT) environment of the MPCL IBP program\nnecessitates the extensive use of information technology (IT) for communications and for\ncommon access to product design data and tools. ASG team member locations include the\nSan Diego design center and offices in Dayton, Ohio. AEG team member locations include\nthe Farmington Hills, Michigan design center and the Marshall, Illinois manufacturing\nfacility (IBP MI IPT, 1995).\n\nTeam Communications. The use of IT for electronic mail communications and electronic\ndata interchange (EDI) is the primary method of team communications beyond telephone\ndiscussions and face-to-face meetings.\nProduct Data Management. The management of product design data for access by all\nmembers of the distributed product team was necessary. This was accomplished through a\nclient-server computer network, with the file server located at ASD in San Diego and with\nclient PCs located in Marshall, Dayton, and Farmington Hills. Product design databases\nsuch as the IBP Components database and the IBP PCB Design Rules database are located\non the file server, which ensure the common and consistent use of IBP design data by both\nproduct engineering and manufacturing, and aids in DFM analysis.\nProduct Design Tools. Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing\n(CAM), and design simulation tools are located on the file server in San Diego for access\nby the all team members.\n3.6.2 Computer Integrated Manufacturing\nThe CIM system installation and upgrade for the IBP program has done more than just\nenable the flexible manufacture of low volume military assemblies. The CIM system is\nalso a contributor to supply chain integration through enabling electronic links between the\nmanufacturing floor and product design and the material requirements planning (MRP II)\nsystem (IBP MI IPT, 1995).\nProduct Design Data Interface. The automatic download of product design data to the\nensures that the product design data held by the manufacturing line is the latest available\nform the product design team.\nScheduling and Order Tracking. The CIM system helps to integrate the supply chain\nthrough the electronic linkage of the Marshall manufacturing line and the MRPII system in\nFarmington Hills.\n\n3.7 MPCL IBP Program Results\nThe pioneering efforts of the MPCL IBP program in demonstrating military-commercial\nintegration with the manufacture of military electronics modules has been enlightening.\nMany lessons have been learned from this program and the results demonstrate its success.\n3.7.1 Lessons Learned\n- Military-commercial integration is operationally achievable\nThe MPCL IBP program has successfully demonstrated that the operational details of\nmilitary-commercial integration are achievable, particularly within the electronics\nmanufacturing environment. This has been demonstrated through design modifications to\nthe military CNI electronics modules which enabled the use of commercial components, the\nuse of automated high-volume commercial manufacturing equipment, and through the\nelimination of business practices and requirement barriers.\n- Commercial Item status is essential for military-commercial integration\nWithout commercial item determination for the CNI electronics modules, the IBP program\nwould not have faired as well. Commercial item status brought about the elimination of\nnumerous contractual clauses and requirements which AEG deemed unacceptable.\n-\nFlexible manufacturing technology is a critical enabler\nThe low volume production of military products has precluded access to the capital\nintensive high-volume production facilities of commercial industry in the past.\nToday\nhowever, flexible manufacturing technologies and CIM systems have reduced the minimum\nscale and set-up times of high volume commercial manufacturing to a level where the\nproduction of defense products is feasible. The MPCL program has demonstrated that this\nis the case for PCB assemblies, which is of particular importance since electronics\ntechnology is one which the commercial development pace exceeds that of the defense\nindustry and where integration is critical.\n\n- Cost reductions can be achieved through integration of the supply chain\nand the use of commercial component technologies\nThe MPCL program results show that product cost reductions can be achieved through the\ncombination of faster production cycles, commercial component technologies, and supply\nchain integration.\n- Technology and knowledge transfer to the commercial supplier have\nbeen developed as assets for future business opportunities.\nTRW AEG is developing its assets in CIM, engineering skills, improved production\nflexibility, and knowledge of military product designs, so that they can be leveraged for\nfuture business opportunities down the road.\n3.7.2 Results Summary\nFigure 3.11 summarizes some of the key program metric results.\nFigure 3.11 IBP Results to Date\nCritical Parameter\nIBP Actual\nDesign to Cost (PNP): 75 units\n$17K\n$16.5K\nDesign to Cost (FEC): 41 units\n$15.6K\n$11.8K\nOverall ROAE\n18%\n19.7%\nMinimum Annual ROAE\n12%\n13%\nNumber of Processes with Cpk>1.33\nNumber of Processes with Set-up\nTime>15min\nWeight (PNP)\n1.12 lbs.\nWeight (FEC)\n1.28 lbs\nIBP Target\n< 1.38 lbs.\n< 1.40 lbs\n(Source: Ebeling, 1997; IBP BP IPT, 1997)\nIt is can be seen from this summary that the IBP program has been successful. The targets\nfor design to cost, ROAE, process capability and weight have all been exceeded, while\nprocess set-up time targets are only slightly off target.\n\nSince product cost reduction is such a key potential benefit of military-commercial\nintegration, a more in-depth discussion of the cost comparison is necessary.\nFigure 3.12 MPCL IBP Cost Comparison\nMPCL IBP\nMilitary\nBaseline\nIBP\nGoal\nCost\nReduction\nCumulative Average Cost\nof First 30 Units\n$10.9K*\n$40K*\n50%\n73%\nAverage Pricing from\nValidation Participants\n$12.7K\n$40K*\n50%\n68%\n* Based on material cost actuals for a quantity of 30 LRM's, in 1996 dollars, AEG profit included, ASD\nprofit and overhead excluded.\n(Source: Ebeling, 1997, IBP BP IPT, 1997)\nFigure 3.12 presents a cost reduction comparison for the MPCL program using two\nmethods. Based on the cumulative average cost per unit of the labor and materials spent to\nproduce the first 30 units, the resulting cost savings over the military baseline is 73%. The\nsecond comparison shown in the figure is against the average validation pricing submitted\nby the eleven validation participants, which resulted in a 68% cost reduction over the\nmilitary baseline. It can be seen that both of these comparison methods yield significant\ncost savings and substantially exceeded the 50% cost reduction target."

Elements from these three research areas have been\narticulated to produce a methodology that allows for the analysis of stakeholder systems. In order to\nsuccessfully apply lean enterprise principles and practices the study of the way in which stakeholders\nare structured along the extended enterprise is an indispensable first step. In a similar manner,\nstakeholder management practices require the identification of the most salient stakeholders together\nwith their motivations to participate in the enterprise's value creation efforts.\n\nOriginal frameworks and methodologies for stakeholder systems analysis are presented in this thesis.\nSeveral qualitative, quantitative and systematic techniques have been developed that allow for the\ncharacterization and mapping of stakeholder networks. Among them are models for stakeholder\nsystems representation, a process for the identification of stakeholders, a method to determine their\nsalience and relationships relevance, and several stakeholder network metrics. Also is proposed and\ndemonstrated the use of Dependency Structure Matrix technique for the analysis of stakeholder\nnetworks structural and functional characteristics. Some of these methodologies rely on known\ntheories and practices such as social network analysis techniques and other graph theoretic concepts\nalthough their combination and further development provide an original set of tools for the analysis of\nstakeholder systems.\n\nAll these methodologies were applied to a real case enterprise scenario. The stakeholder system of a\nrelatively small space application enterprise was analyzed and characterized. Several important\nconclusions were derived from this enterprise's stakeholder analysis, demonstrating the capabilities and\nadequacy of the methods and techniques proposed.\n\nThesis supervisor: Deborah J.

The concepts and principles of what later was going to be\nknown as the lean enterprise model, that had demonstrated their positive effect in the auto\nindustry in Japan, were later researched and documented by members of the International Motor\nVehicle Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Based on the results from that\nresearch the landmark book The Machine that Changed the World was published in 1990. The book\nextensively covered the principles and practices Toyota successfully applied to the production of\ncars, and compared those with the more traditional methods of American and European\ncompanies. Thus it was evident that a change in the occidental way of doing in that industry was\nnecessary to regain competitiveness in the market. The lean production model and its subsequent\nlean enterprise model was the answer to that required change.\nIt was soon reasoned that the same methods were applicable to other industries and businesses as\nwell. One of the most important movements towards lean implementations was done by the\nAmerican aerospace industry, a highly competitive and complex business environment. MIT's\nLean Aerospace Initiative, a joint effort of the industry, government and academia, was created\nalmost a decade ago to respond to the lean implementation needs in the aerospace industry that\nwas willing to project effectively to the 21st century. One of the maxims of the Lean Aerospace\nInitiative expresses that \"a lean enterprise is an integrated entity which efficiently creates value for\nits multiple stakeholders by employing lean principles and practices.\"1\n\n1 Lean Aerospace Initiative website, http://lean.mit.edu\n- 11 -\n\nIt is widely recognized within the lean enterprise body of research that stakeholders are essential\nto the successful implementation of lean principles and practices. In fact, the stakeholder\nviewpoint is of extreme importance when analyzing the value creation processes an enterprise\nmust plan and implement in order to be competitive and survive in its market environment.\nKnowing who the receptors of the value creation processes will be is essential to define the\ndirection the enterprise will take when considering its strategies, tactics, and operations.\nPractically in every enterprise the stakeholders form a very complex system of relationships that\nneeds to be well understood to properly implement lean principles and practices. Traditional\nstakeholders include customers (in their multiple forms of end users, acquirers, and/or distributors),\nowners (capitalists, shareholders, and corporations), suppliers (first-tier, second-tier, etc.), and employee\ngroups (unions, minority groups, managers, blue collars, etc.) However, the list does not end there;\nmany other secondary stakeholders may, at some point or another, acquire relevance and enhance\nor even interfere with an enterprise's value creation process. Consider, for example, the pressures\nof environmentalist groups over the nuclear power industry. The nuclear industry was developing\nat a regular and strong pace until the accidents first of Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and\nlater of Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union in 1986.2 Environmentalist groups, acting as\nlegitimate stakeholders since then, have used those two unfortunate examples as a claim to stop\nany further nuclear activity at many different local, national, and international forums. The effects\nof those pressures on the nuclear industry have been devastating. Not a single power plant has\nbeen ordered in the US since the Three Mile Island accident.\nMoreover, the relationships among stakeholders are typically complex and dynamic. It is not\nunusual to find certain stakeholders exerting power by means of another stakeholder that has a\nstronger position with respect to the enterprise. The pressures of environmentalist groups on the\nnuclear industry were not applied directly to the nuclear companies but using instead the media\nand political lobby to strongly influence in the lack of support to the industry.\n\n2 Meltdown at Three Mile Island, http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/three/index.html\n\n- 12 -\n\nThe stakeholder view of the firm can be applied at many different levels in an enterprise whether\nthat is the definition of the enterprise's growth strategies, the elaboration of operation plans, the\nanalysis of the needs of different stakeholders and their influence on product architecture, design,\nand implementation, and so forth. It can also be applied to different enterprise scenarios, for\nexample, the analysis of the value creation for just one of the products of the enterprise, a family\nof products, or multiple different products of the enterprise.\nIn summary, the analysis of stakeholders - who they are and how they are structured - is of\nfundamental importance when developing value creation opportunities within the lean enterprise\nmodel framework. The complexity of the stakeholder system requires the use of many system\ndesign and management methods and tools for its understanding.\nThesis Objectives\nEvery non-adventurous journey needs of a map to indicate how to get from here to there. That\nmap can be as simple as verbal directions, or as sophisticated as a GPS-based electronic map, but\nneeds to be there to conduct someone to a destination. Tracing a map involves careful\nobservation and knowledge of the terrain's details; one needs to identify what the different\nreferential elements are (mountains, valleys, rivers, and routes, among others), how are they\ncontained in the mapping area of interest, and finally how those elements are interrelated (after a\nroute intersection comes a bridge, after the bridge there is a winding road, and so forth). Only\nafter this analytical process one is able to draw and eventually use the map. The final product will\nnot tell which is the best strategy or the best route to go from point A to point B, but will be\nessential to plan and later to implement the journey. Using maps we humans, or more recently,\nintelligent computer applications, can design the most efficient way and even alternate routes to\nconnect two points.\nImplementing a lean enterprise initiative is a long journey - most likely a never-ending journey\nthat must be carefully planned and frequently revised if one is willing to succeed. Thus any lean\nenterprise initiative will have need of many different level maps in order to achieve the initiative's\npartial or final goals. As we stated before, the practices associated with stakeholder analysis are\n\n- 13 -\n\ncrucial for the implementation of lean enterprise initiatives. The main objective of this thesis\nwork is to develop qualitative and quantitative tools that aid us in constructing the maps needed\nto traverse the field of stakeholder analysis. We certainly are not looking for strategies or tactics to\nnavigate stakeholder maps; the existent literature on the subject is plagued with should-do-this-or-\nthat recommendations. We are looking for frameworks, methods, and tools that aid us in building\nand understanding such maps.\nStakeholders are the rivers, mountains, and valleys of stakeholder systems maps. We need to\nunderstand who they are, why are they interested in the enterprise, and how they are structured\nwith respect to the enterprise. Consequently, the objectives of this thesis work are to provide\ntools and frameworks that can be applied by enterprises' managers to assist in the understanding\nof stakeholders systems. In particular, we will be looking for tools that allow for:\n3⁄4 The identification of the stakeholders of an enterprise, including the determination of\nthe boundaries of its stakeholder system.\n3⁄4 The assessment of the salience or relevance of each stakeholder\n3⁄4 The discovery of the structure of the stakeholder system in order to assess its\ncomplexity and the actions derived from that.\n\nThesis Outline\nChapter 2 presents some of the history and fundamental principles of the lean enterprise model\nof the firm. It also covers the Value Creation framework that will be essential for the development\nof our stakeholder analysis tools. Chapter 3 presents some common definitions and practices\nfound in stakeholder theory. Chapter 4 introduces some supporting theories, like social networks\nand complexity theory that will help us to develop our proposed stakeholder analysis tools.\nChapter 5 presents qualitative frameworks for stakeholder analysis, and Chapter 6 elaborates on\nmore quantitative or analytical tools. Chapter 7 develops an application example of those tools to\na real case scenario. Finally, Chapter 8 presents the conclusions and possible future work related\nwith the content of this thesis.\n\n- 14 -\n\nC H A P T E R 2\nLEAN ENTERPRISES\nThis chapter presents some of the fundamental concepts, principles, and practices of what is\nknown today as the Lean Enterprise model. Most importantly, the lean value creation framework\nis introduced, where the relevance of stakeholder analysis becomes evident.\nLean Production\nIt was in 1990 when James Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos wrote the book The Machine\nthat Changed the World.3 In their book they established the basis for what today is known as the\nLean Enterprise Paradigm. They explained, after many years of research in the automotive\nindustry, how some Japanese companies had changed for good the mass-production concept\ndeveloped by Henry Ford and widely used by North American and European companies. This\nnew production paradigm was called Lean Production. Led by the Toyota company efforts, lean\nproduction was aimed at reducing - or more profoundly, eliminating any source of waste from the\nproduction system. The term 'lean' was used in this context because this production method\nutilized less of everything when compared to mass-production: less material inventories, less time\nto develop a new product, less time to produce a car, less space in the plant, and so on. In other\nwords, it meant reducing any step or process that consumed some resource and did not add value\nto the final product.\nThe focus of The Machine that Changed the World was mainly on production, although it analyzed the\nupstream and downstream factors that affected it, such as product development and engineering,\nsupply-chain coordination, and customer relationship management. In other terms, lean\nproduction focuses only on manufacturing efficiency, which typically is expressed as:\nManufacturing Efficiency = Product produced / Resources Consumed by Manufacturing\n\n3 Womack J.P., Jones D.T., and Roos D., The Machine That Changed The World: The Story of Lean Production (New York:\nHarperPerennial, 1991)\n\n- 15 -\n\nLean Thinking\nWomack and Jones' second book, Lean Thinking,4 expanded the concepts of lean production to\ncover other aspects of the lean enterprise model, providing a more holistic view of the firm. They\nstated in this book that lean is a way of thinking about an organization and its processes, and is the\ndriving force behind the integration of the individual lean efforts carried out in each one of the\nactivities or processes of the enterprise. They introduced the five basic principles of lean thinking:\nspecify the value of specific products, identify the value stream for each product, make value flow\nwithout interruptions, let the customer pull value from the producer, and pursue perfection.\nAccording to Womack and Jones value can only be defined by the ultimate customer of a product\nor service. A product shows value when it satisfies customer's needs at an acceptable price at a\nspecific time. A product's value is created by the producer. Creating value is the ultimate reason of\nwhy an enterprise exists. We will see later that value must not only be created for end customers\nbut also for all participants (stakeholders) involved with the enterprise.\nThe value stream is the process or set of activities required to bring a product or service from its\nconception to its final delivery form to the customer. Identifying the value stream for each\nproduct helps in discovering opportunities to apply lean practices. This analysis allows for\nmapping three types of activities that are typically present in every value stream of any enterprise:\nactivities that unambiguously create or add value to the end product; activities that create no value\nbut are necessary to support the value creation activities; and activities that add no value nor\nsupport any other activity. Making more efficient the type two activities and eliminating the type\nthree activities contribute to the goal of achieving a lean enterprise. Value stream analysis should\nbe performed for all the activities necessary to produce a product or service. This involves\nthinking beyond the boundaries of the firm and incorporating into the process other actors\n(stakeholders) that contribute to produce the final product.\n\n4 Womack J.P., Jones D.T., Lean Thinking (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996)\n\n- 16 -\n\nValue creation steps must flow through the enterprise. This means that the interfaces between any\ntwo activities in the value stream - whether they are internal or external to the firm, must be\nminimized and streamlined in such a way that the product does not encounter any resistance\n(non-value added activities) in moving to the next step in the process.\nThe end customer must pull the products from the producer rather than the producer to push\nproducts to the customers. Complying with this principle will ensure that no unwanted\ninventories will be waiting for customers to buy them. In the extreme application of this principle\nan enterprise should solely produce a unit of a product only when a real customer demands it.\nThe same principle must be applied for every step in the value stream: no upstream activity must\nproduce its goods unless a downstream step requires them.\nThe analysis of the above mentioned principles should be done continuously in order to pursue\nperfection in the goal of achieving a lean enterprise. An enterprise is not a static entity but rather it\nchanges according to new opportunities in its environment and the actions of other parties.\nPursuing those opportunities and constructing on the actions of others will inevitable generate\ndifferent reactions among the internal and external constituents of the enterprise. Many of these\nreactions will certainly open new opportunities for improvement.\nAn overarching principle and practice of lean thinking is the implacable search and elimination of\nmuda at every level in the enterprise. Muda is the Japanese word for useless or waste. It represents\nall the activities or processes that consume a resource of any nature but do not add value to the\nfinal product - the third type of activity in the description of the value stream above. The most\ncommon types of muda as defined by Taiichi Ohno, the creator of the Toyota Production\nSystem, are: mistakes in any step of the production process, overproduction of parts or final\nproducts, excessive inventory of raw materials, unnecessary processing, unnecessary motion of\npeople, unnecessary transportation of goods, and waiting times. Although this list was originally\napplied to Toyota's manufacturing processes it well represents the sources of waste that are\ntypically found in other levels or processes of any enterprise.\n\n- 17 -\n\nHowever, when considering enterprise level waste, it is important to add two important sources\nof waste to the ones described above: opportunity costs, and structural inefficiencies.5\nOpportunity Cost waste results, for example, from lost opportunities in the marketplace or ill-\ndefined business strategies. Structural Inefficiency waste is produced, for example, by\ninappropriate organizational structures, or bad business model structures.\nLean Enterprise Value\nA lean enterprise can be measured by its efficiency in creating value to all the stakeholders. In this\ncase, we can express the efficiency of a lean enterprise by the following relation:\nLean Enterprise Efficiency = Value Created for All Stakeholders / All Contributions to the Enterprise\nIt is important to understand the components of this equation. In a recently published book, Lean\nEnterprise Value,6 written by members of MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative (LAI), the three\nconcepts - lean, enterprise, and value are explained in great detail. An enterprise is the\ninterconnected whole comprised of one or more organizations having related activities, unified\noperation, and a common business purpose. We will extend on this definition later but in essence\nan enterprise is formed by all the internal operative entities of a firm plus all the organizations that\nhelp in the process of value creation. All these different entities constitute what is known as the\nstakeholders of an enterprise: those entities that hold a 'stake' or a legitimate interest in the results of\nthe operations and strategies of the enterprise. In order to survive, an enterprise must create value\nfor each and every one of its stakeholders. Each stakeholder will essentially be looking for\ndifferent gains, utilities or benefits in exchange for its contribution to an enterprise. Stakeholders'\ncontributions can be of various forms ranging from different types of resources (financial, raw\nmaterials, plant capacity, work hours, etc.) to supporting activities (media coverage, government\nregulations, etc.) The value or benefit one stakeholder is looking for very often conflicts with that\nof many others as not all the stakeholders necessarily obtain value from the end products\n\n5 'Enterprise Level Waste', lecture notes from MIT's graduate level course 16.852J \"Integrating the Lean Enterprise\"\n6 Murman E. et al., Lean Enterprise Value (New York: Palgrave, 2002)\n\n- 18 -\n\ndelivered by the enterprise. A lean enterprise reaches its highest efficiency when all the\nstakeholders are satisfied by what they obtain from their contributions.\nValue Creation Framework\nThe authors of Lean Enterprise Value suggest a value-creation framework that has three phases:\nvalue identification, value proposition, and value delivery (\n). They define that value is\ncreated for each stakeholder when they find adequate worth, utility, benefit, or reward in exchange\nfor their contributions to the enterprise. A necessary first step involves the identification of all the\nstakeholders that form the enterprise. Only then can the value identification analysis step be\nperformed, which involves determining and understanding the needs, interests, and benefits each\none of the stakeholders expects from contributing and participating in the enterprise. A first\nattempt to align portions of the entire value stream map to those needs must be done at this stage,\ndetermining which activities add value to which stakeholder.\nFigure 1\nDuring the value proposition phase a value trade off analysis must be performed to obtain a fair\nvalue offer for each stakeholder, one that reflects as much as possible its needs and interests. That\ntrade off results from the differences in the values pursued by each one of the stakeholders. A\nlean enterprise should strive to provide a balanced and a robust value proposition. A balanced value\nproposition is one that is agreed and accepted by each and every one the stakeholders of the\nenterprise. While this agreement process is not easy it is essential for the survival of the enterprise.\nA robust value proposition allows for changes in the enterprise environment to occur without\ngreatly affecting the balance of the value offer to the stakeholders.\nThe value delivery phase corresponds to what is typically known as the implementation phase. In\nmany cases this phase takes the form of a manufacturing process but can also represent the\ndelivery of a service, or any other process that actually embodies the exchange of value with\nstakeholders. Most of the realizations of lean we see today have focused on this last phase, and\nhave applied lean principles only to 'do the job right' when producing products to end customers.\nThe value-creation framework helps in ensuring that an enterprise is 'doing the right job'.\n\n- 19 -\n\nSource: Murman et al., Lean Enterprise Value\nValue\nIdentification\nValue\nProposition\nValue\nDelivery\nIteration and adpatation process\n\nFigure 1: Value Creation Framework\nThe value-creation process is far from being static because value, stakeholders, and value\npropositions need to be frequently reevaluated in order to respond to each enterprise particular\ndynamic environment. In addition, the value-creation framework should be applied across all the\nrelevant levels of an enterprise. This means analyzing the entire enterprise, paying attention to the\ndifferent products, product lines, programs, and projects; and considering the local, national, and\ninternational impact of the enterprise actions.\nCreating adequate value to all the stakeholders, providing balanced value propositions, and\nefficiently delivering value should be the ultimate objective of the waste elimination efforts that\nare carried out when implementing lean thinking practices. Waste elimination by itself does not\nhelp to achieve a better or a leaner enterprise. The goal of waste elimination must be directed by\nwhat the authors of Lean Enterprise Value call the 'true north' of any lean effort, which is precisely\na value centered view of the entire enterprise. Becoming lean is a process of eliminating waste\nwith the goal of creating value, not only for end users but also for all other stakeholders in an\nenterprise. A lean enterprise is an integrated entity that efficiently creates value for its multiple\nstakeholders by employing lean principles and practices.\nStakeholders and the Lean Enterprise\nA lean enterprise consists of a set of more or less integrated entities such as owners, partners,\nsuppliers, and customers, among others. These constitute, precisely, the stakeholders of the\n\n- 20 -\n\nenterprise who together with it pursue and accomplish its value-creation processes. This\nenterprise of enterprises system is what the authors of Lean Enterprise Value have called the\n'extended enterprise'. This system of interdependent entities is what will be referred throughout\nthis thesis as the stakeholder system, whereas the extended enterprise will be referred simply as\nthe enterprise.\nOne of the principles of lean enterprise value creation states that value must be delivered only\nafter identifying stakeholder value and constructing robust value propositions. To this end\nstakeholders must be identified, their needs must be determined - find the reasons why they\nparticipate in the enterprise, their relative importance for the enterprise's processes must be\nevaluated, and the effect of stakeholder interdependencies and structure on the enterprise must be\nunderstood.\nAny structural inefficiency that might be present at any level in the enterprise will create waste and\nwill hinder the creation of value for some or all of the enterprise stakeholders. As stated before,\nstructural inefficiencies may come from inappropriate organizational structures. This includes, but\nit is not limited to, poorly integrated stakeholders to the activities of the enterprise and the\nexistence of unnecessary interfaces among stakeholders that impede collaboration and processes\ncoordination. The lean enterprise paradigm calls for the rationalization of those interfaces -\nsources of waste - and the creation of a more cooperative environment among all stakeholders to\nefficiently achieve the goals of the enterprise.\nWe will see later in this thesis work that not only stakeholders' identification is necessary for\nguiding the value-creation processes of an enterprise. Knowing how stakeholders are structured\nand organized in relation with the enterprise, and what types of relationships exist among them is\nof great importance to the achievement of a lean enterprise. The complexity of the organizational\nrelationships among different stakeholders and its consequences on the value creation processes\nrepresent both, a threat to the enterprise lean transformation, and a source of opportunities to\nsuccessfully push the enterprise forward into the future.\n\n- 21 -\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n- 22 -\n\nC H A P T E R 3\nSTAKEHOLDER THEORY\nKnowing who the enterprise's stakeholders are, their relevance, how they are structured, and why\ndo they participate in the efforts of an integrated enterprise are key factors to properly define and\nimplement a value creation process that conducts to a better implementation of lean principles\nand practices. This chapter serves as an introduction to the stakeholder theory, which is precisely,\naimed at answering the above-mentioned questions. The chapter will cover some common\ndefinitions necessary to frame the theory and then it will go to the details of the issues that form\nthe theory as it is known today.\nIntroduction\nThe idea that enterprises have stakeholders is not new and has become commonplace in both\nacademic and business thinking for the last 40 years. Stakeholder analysis has been applied to\nmany diverse areas of study and applications such as economics, marketing, corporate\ngovernance, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, environmental issues, organizational\nstudies, and so forth.\nThe stakeholder theory of the firm and its management implications contrasts with more\ntraditional management control practices that are aimed exclusively at satisfying shareholder's\n(owners) interests. Some scholars (Donaldson and Preston, 1995) have focused on the problem of\njustifying the stakeholder theory as a valid alternative to those more 'conventional' practices.\nAlthough there is still not enough empirical evidence or analytical arguments that the enterprise\nefficiency is enhanced by practicing stakeholder management, there exist normative assumptions\nthat allows for its justification. In particular, Donaldson and Preston argue that the stakeholder\ntheory can be justified based on the \"evolving theory of property\". This theory's traditional view\nhas been that a focus on property rights justifies the dominance of shareowners' interests.\nHowever, property rights are typically limited, i.e. the right of ownership is applicable up to the\n\n- 23 -\n\npoint where, for example, harmful uses of the property are exerted. These restrictions on property\nrights immediately bring in the concept of the existence of 'others' whose own interests (stakes)\nimpose and exercise those limitations. Consequently, managers must focus their efforts not only\nshareholders but on many other stakeholders as well if they want to adequately defend property\nrights.\nSupporters of stakeholder theory believe it key to more effective management and to a more\nuseful, comprehensive theory of the role of the enterprise in society.7 Kochan and Rubinstein\n(2000) present an excellent historical perspective of why the shareholder-centric view of the\ncorporation and its correspondent management practices gained momentum in the past centuries,\nparticularly within the American context. They also explain from historical facts why the\nstakeholders' viewpoint of the corporation is acquiring relevance since a few decades ago. They\nargue that the debate on which of these two points of view must prevail is going to continue as\nlong as the question of how to obtain a more balanced and equitable distribution of social\nbenefits and risks among multiple stakeholders remains unanswered. In order to bring some light\nto this argument they present the key distinctions between a shareholder-wealth-maximizing firm\nand a stakeholder firm. A summary of those key differences is presented in\n. In between\nthese two extreme 'pure' models of the firm there exists a continuum of approaches where some\ncharacteristics of both models are present at the same time. For example, for some corporations\nthe development of strategic alliances can satisfy attributes of both the shareholder and the\nstakeholder model of the firm. An alliance can be pursued in order to neutralize a competitor (co-\noption), to combine different set of resources and capabilities (cospecialization), and/or to learn\nand internalize new skills.8 A stakeholder orientation of an alliance will indicate that a win-win\ntype of relationship between the parties must be established. On the contrary, a shareholder\norientation will view an alliance as a means for achieving higher returns (profits) to the owners or\nas a way of perpetuating the power position of the firm. Of course, the other party will be looking\nfor the same goals thus generating the tensions we commonly observe in this type of alliances.\nTable 1\n\n7 See, for example, Mitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997)\n8 The terms co-option and cospecialization and their related concepts are from Doz Y.L. and Hamel G. (1998)\n\n- 24 -\n\nTable 1: Key differences between a Shareholder Firm and a Stakeholder Firm\nAttribute\nShareholder Firm\nStakeholder Firm\nGoal(s)\nMaximize shareholder wealth\nPursue multiple objectives\nof parties with different\ninterests\nGovernance Structure and\nKey Processes\nPrincipal-Agent Model: Managers are\nagents of shareholders.

This is\nanalogous to what we have expressed about lean enterprises in the previous chapter. There we\nstated that an integrated stakeholder viewpoint is of fundamental importance to the analysis of a\nlean enterprise.\nTwo questions are of great significance in stakeholder theory: who are the stakeholders (how to\nidentify them), and how to define the boundaries of the enterprise in terms of which are the\nrelevant stakeholders to consider (who are the most salient stakeholders).\nStakeholders - A formal definition\nThe term 'stakeholder' is inevitably associated with the idea of stockholder - the investors in or\nowners of a business. Stockholders are very important for financially and economically supporting\na company's activities, but they are not the only ones who provide some kind of support.\nStakeholder is a more comprehensive term involving other relevant actors that are essential for\n\n- 25 -\n\nthe life and continuity of an enterprise. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a stake as\n\"that which is placed at hazard, esp. a sum of money, etc. deposited or guaranteed, to be taken by\nthe winner of a game, race, contest, etc.\" It also defines 'To have a stake in (an event, concern, etc.)' as\n\"to have something to gain or lose by the turn of events.\" A stake then is an interest or a share in\nan undertaking. A stake is also a claim (tacit, or legal), a demand for something due or believed to\nbe due. In between these two extremes of a simple interest and a legal claim is a 'right' for\nsomething, which can be either legal or moral (Carroll and Buchholtz, 2002).\nIn order to be able to precisely identify an enterprise's stakeholders we have to have a formal and\ncomplete definition of what constitutes one. Many scholars have provided different definitions,\nusually tailored to their particular area of study. Mitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997) present a\nchronology that shows how the definition of the term stakeholder evolved over the years. A\nsummary of that chronology is shown in T\n.\nable 2\nProbably the most widely accepted definition of what constitutes a stakeholder is given by R.\nEdward Freeman in his landmark book, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach,9 where he\nstates that \"stakeholder is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the\nachievement of the firm's objectives\"\nTo put this definition in the terms of this thesis work we need to say that 'the firm' should be\nactually what we have defined as 'enterprise' in the previous chapter. It is the whole enterprise\nsystem, and most likely some components more than others, that is affected by the achievement\nof the objectives of the firm. Reciprocally, the actions or inactions of each and every element of\nthe enterprise (stakeholders) affect the attainment of those objectives. This talks about the\ncomplexity of the stakeholder system where strong and weak interdependencies alike can\ndestabilize the enterprise system.\n\n9 See Freeman R.E., 1984\n\n- 26 -\n\nTable 2: Different definitions of the stakeholder term\nDate\nAuthor(s)\nDefinition\nStanford memo\n\"those groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist\"\nRhenman\n\"are depending on the firm in order to achieve their personal goals and on whom\nthe firm is depending for its existence\"\nAhlstedt\n&\nJahnukainen\n\"driven by their own interests and goals are participants in a firm, and thus\ndepending on it and whom for its sake the firm is depending\nFreeman & Reed\nWide: \"can affect the achievement of an organization's objectives or who is\naffected by the achievement of an organization's objectives\"\nNarrow: \"on which the organization is dependent for its continued survival\"\nFreeman\n\"can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives\"\nFreeman&Gilbert\n\"can affect or is affected by a business\"\nCornell & Shapiro\n\"claimants\" who have \"contracts\"\nEvan & Freeman\n\"have a stake in or claim on the firm\"\nEvan & Freeman\n\"benefit from or are harmed by, and whose rights are violated or respected by,\ncorporate actions\"\nBowie\n\"without whose support the organization would cease to exist\"\nAlkhafaji\n\"groups to whom the corporation is responsible\"\nCarroll\n\"asserts to have one or more of these kinds of stakes\" - \"ranging from an\ninterest to a right (legal or moral) to ownership or legal title to the company's\nassets or property\"\nFreeman & Evan\nContract holders\nThompson et al.\nIn \"relationship with an organization\"\nSavage et al.\n\"have an interest in the actions of an organization and... the ability to influence\nit\"\nHill & Jones\n\"constituents who have a legitimate claim on the firm... established through the\nexistence of an exchange relationship\" who supply \"the firm with critical\nresources (contributions) and in exchange each expects its interests to be satisfied\n(by inducements)\"\nBrenner\n\"having some legitimate, non-trivial relationship with an organization [such as]\nexchange transactions, action impacts, and moral responsibilities\"\nCarroll\n\"asserts to have one or more of the kinds of stakes in business\" - may be\naffected or affect...\nFreeman\nParticipants in \"the human process of joint value creation\"\nWicks et al.\n\"interact with and give meaning and definition to the corporation\"\nLangtry\nThe firm is significantly responsible for their well-being, or they hold a moral or\nlegal claim on the firm\nStarik\n\"can and are making their actual stakes known\" - \"are or might be influenced by\n, or are or potentially are influencers of, some organization\"\nClarkson\n\"bear some form of risk as a result of having invested some form of capital,\nhuman or financial, something of value, in a firm\" or \"are placed at risk as a\nresult of a firm's activities\"\nClarkson\n\"have, or claim, ownership, rights, or interests in a corporation and its activities\"\nNasi\n\"interact with the firm and thus make its operation possible\"\nBrenner\n\"are or which could impact or be impacted by the firm/organization\"\nDonaldson\n&\nPreston\n\"persons or groups with legitimate interests in procedural and/or substantive\naspects of corporate activity\"\nSource: Mitchell, Agle, and Wood, 1997\n\n- 27 -\n\nAnother obvious addition to Freeman's definition is the consideration of the possibility of an\nenterprise to fail in attaining its objectives, i.e. the objectives of a firm are not always achieved as\nplanned. If this were the case, some or all the stakeholders and most likely the whole enterprise\nsystem will be negatively affected.\nIn terms of the objectives, if they are not properly defined using either the previously described\nvalue creation framework or any other method that takes into account the benefits to all\nstakeholders, a sub-optimization of the integrated value creation process will be obtained.\nTherefore, we assert that the objectives do not belong to a particular firm but must be defined for\nall the stakeholders - those who define the entire enterprise, which also includes the firm under\nstudy. This is not more than the construction of balanced and robust value proposition we\nmentioned in the previous chapter. Furthermore, the objectives can be partially attained and still\nbe delivering some value to some of the stakeholders in the enterprise system. Each of the actions\nand results of the value creation processes can potentially benefit some stakeholders and even the\nentire enterprise.\nThere are other factors other than the achievement of objectives that can influence as well the\nstakeholder system. For example, the effects of an energy regulation policy implemented by a\nlocal government (a typical stakeholder of any enterprise) can impact on the results of the entire\nenterprise. This can constitute the root cause by which the income objectives for the year will not\nbe met, thus affecting all the enterprise financial or economical structure. Because the goal of\nevery enterprise is the creation of value (not only monetary value but also societal values) we will\nuse this concept to define the level of achievement of the enterprise.\nThe 'affect or is affected by' portion of Freeman's definition also needs to be interpreted. The use\nof the verb 'affect' here implies the existence of levels or grades in the consequences derived from\nthe actions of the enterprise. It also suggests that there is some relationship element connecting\nthe parties being it an exchange mechanism (e.g., commercial contract, financial transaction),\nsome type of influence relationship (e.g. political or media pressures), or any other kind of\ninteraction (e.g. environmental issues), in which those consequences are reflected. Freeman's\n\n- 28 -\n\ndefinition allows for both unidirectional and bi-directional type of relationships. The\nconsequences of the achievement of an objective can be direct or indirect depending on how the\nstakeholder is related to the enterprise. If the stakeholder in question is of less relevance to the\nenterprise (meaning his/her stake has less relative value or is less risky than those of other\nstakeholders) then the consequences or impacts on him/her will be less important. Also, the\nconsequences can be of many different types: economical, environmental, political, and social, just\nto mention some of the most important.\nAlthough it is difficult to formulate a thorough explanation of what constitutes a stakeholder, one\nthat includes all the elements presented above, we will provide here the following broad\ndefinition: stakeholder is any group or individual who directly or indirectly affects or is\naffected by the level of achievement of an enterprise's value creation processes. This\nextensive definition allows us not to arbitrarily exclude any stakeholder from our lean enterprise\nanalysis. Also, by including the value creation framework, this definition ties some of the\nstakeholder theory concepts with the lean enterprise model we described in the previous chapter.\nStakeholder Identification\nThe above adopted broad definition of what constitute a stakeholder still leaves us with the\nproblem of the identification of those stakeholders that really count for the creation of value.\nAccording to that definition virtually any entity can affect or be affected by an enterprise's actions.\nBecause an enterprise, as we briefly stated in the previous chapter, is a complex system of\norganizational (stakeholder) relationships, determining which stakeholder is relevant and which is\nnot is normally a difficult task. Like in any complex system, even a negligible contribution by an\ninsignificant stakeholder can potentially produce a strong impact on the whole enterprise system.\nAs the butterfly effect (frequently used by complexity theorists) explains it: \"a butterfly flapping\nits wings in China can cause a severe storm in New England.\" Consequently, the stakeholder\ntheory needs a reliable mechanism to identify which are the relevant stakeholders and to define\nclear boundaries of the stakeholders system.\n\n- 29 -\n\nMitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997) propose a way of classifying stakeholders by their possession of\none or more of the following attributes: the stakeholder power to influence the firm; the legitimacy\nof the stakeholder relationship with the firm under study; and the urgency of the stakeholder claim\non the firm.\nA stakeholder demonstrates power in its relationship with an enterprise when it has or can gain\naccess to coercive, utilitarian, or symbolic means to impose its will (or the will of others) in the\nrelationship. Coercive power is that related with the use of physical resources of force, violence,\nor restraint. Utilitarian power is that based on the exchange of material or financial resources.\nSymbolic power is that based on symbolic resources - normative symbols, like prestige and\nesteem; and social symbols, like love and acceptance.\nLegitimacy is defined as \"a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are\ndesirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values,\nbeliefs, and definitions\" (Mitchell, Agle, and Wood, 1997; cf. Suchman, 1995). Legitimacy and\npower can exist independently or can be combined to create authority (power that is attached to a\nposition that others perceive as legitimate)\nUrgency, according to Mitchell, Agle, and Wood, is the necessary attribute to provide their\nstakeholder identification model with dynamic characteristics. Urgency exists when two\nconditions are met: (1) when a relationship or claim is of a time-sensitive nature and (2) when that\nrelationship or claim is important or critical to the stakeholder operations and/or strategies.\nInstead, we prefer to identify this urgency attribute as criticality since this term involves both\nurgency (time sensitivity) and importance sub-attributes. In this way, some claim that is perceived\nas important but still not urgent can be considered as relevant, and vice versa. This distinction will\nallow us, for example, to identify and incorporate stakeholders with whom an enterprise defines\nlong-term strategic issues (e.g. strategic alliances) that are of keen importance to the entire\nenterprise system.\n\n- 30 -\n\nAny of the attributes of power, legitimacy, and criticality are dynamic in nature, each one\nconstituting a variable that can adopt different values according to the environment and the\nparticular circumstances an enterprise is traversing. Also, all these attributes are socially\nconstructed, not objective reality - meaning that they are subject to multiple and different\nperceptions. Moreover, the actual presence of one or more of the attributes does not mean either\nthat the stakeholder or the managers are conscious of the level of those attributes, or that they are\nwilling to act on the inferences that are possibly made from them.\nAlso, it is interesting to note that this identification methodology allows for the possession of\nmore than one attribute of the same type. For example, a stakeholder relationship with an\nenterprise can be legitimate because both a legal contract and a moral right are recognized as valid\nbetween the parties.\nStakeholder Salience\nOnce stakeholders are identified a mechanism for prioritizing stakeholders is crucial to determine\nto whom and to what managers must actually pay attention. In the work by Mitchell, Agle, and\nWood (1997) they propose a theory of stakeholder salience that helps in determining the priority\nmanagers should assign to dynamically changing stakeholder relationships. Stakeholder salience\nderives from manager's perception about stakeholder's control of some of the attributes of\npower, legitimacy, and criticality. Various stakeholder types emerge from the possession of one or\nmore of the three attributes and the different possible combinations of them.\nBuilding on the propositions of Mitchell, Agle, and Wood we assert that the salience of a\nstakeholder is determined by both the cumulative number of attributes (of same or different type)\nand the relative strength or intensity of each one of those attributes. This latter property will help\nus later in defining a quantifiable way of determining the salience of each stakeholder participating\nin the enterprise.\nLatent stakeholders are those possessing only one of the attributes of power, legitimacy, or\ncriticality, and include dormant, discretionary, and demanding stakeholders (Figure 2) Expectant\n\n- 31 -\n\nstakeholders are those possessing two different attributes, and include dominant, dependent, and\ndangerous stakeholders. Definitive stakeholders are those possessing all three attributes. By\nexclusion, individuals or groups possessing none of the attributes are either nonstakeholders or\npotential stakeholders.\nAny stakeholder in any of the described categories can change its condition by acquiring or losing\none or more of three types of attributes. Managers should be aware of the fact that any\nstakeholder can suddenly change (increase or decrease) its salience property, which will demand a\nproper adjustment to the attention to stakeholder's claims.\nSource: Mitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997)\n\nFigure 2: Stakeholder identification and salience framework\n\n- 32 -\n\nWe recognize that the presence of one or more stakeholder legitimacy attributes, as defined by\nMitchell et al., depends on some kind of contribution from either the stakeholder or the firm side.\nKochan and Rubinstein (2000) propose that salience or the level of stakeholder influence on the\nfirm is a function of (1) the number or quantity of valued resources contributed by potential\nstakeholders, (2) the level of risk and failure costs associated with the relationship between\nstakeholders and the firm, and (3) the power they have or exert in or over the firm. They go\nfurther in the definitions by explaining that the contribution of valued resources \"creates\nincentives for others to recognize a potential stakeholder\" while having those resources\ncompromised at risk in the relationship give stakeholders a moral claim or right. Both of these\ncharacteristics give legitimacy rights to potential or actual stakeholders. As we have expressed\nbefore, combining legitimacy with stakeholders' power position and the urgency or importance of\ntheir stakes gives stakeholders a definitive salience.\nStakeholder Structure\nHaving described the theory behind stakeholder definition, identification, and salience, we still\nneed to make a description of the issue of stakeholder structure. A comprehensive stakeholder\ntheory of the firm requires an explanation of how stakeholders influence the firm and how the\nfirm responds to those influences (Rowley, 1997)\nA first attempt to explain stakeholder structure was done by Freeman when he depicted a\nstakeholder map in which the firm was the hub of a wheel and stakeholders were at the ends of\nspokes around the wheel (Frooman, 1999). A graphical representation of that type of structure is\nshown in\n.\nFigure 3\nHowever, in this conceptualization relationships are dyadic, i.e. only between an individual\nstakeholder and a firm. Also, the firm is positioned in the center of the figure concentrating the\nlinks and relationships with each and every stakeholder. However, in reality the set of\nrelationships are hardly independent from one another and the position of the firm is not typically\ncentral. Moreover, the focus of most stakeholder analysis theories is on the actor's attributes and\nnot in the relationships' attributes. These relationship attributes may tell a lot about how\n\n- 33 -\n\nstakeholders interact and potentate in order to exert power or to claim rights on the firm results.\nThus, the analysis of the relationships and its attributes constitute an essential viewpoint to\nunderstand the way stakeholders influence on the enterprise decisions and actions. Frooman\nstates that relationships among stakeholders and the firm are the elements that actually exhibit the\npower attribute. This contrasts with our previous descriptions, where one of the main attributes\nof stakeholders was precisely the power characteristic (Mitchell et al., 1997) In consequence, it is\nthe stakeholder structure together with stakeholder attributes that provides the power or influence\ncharacteristics of the integral enterprise. We will propose later in this thesis work mechanism to\nevaluate the stakeholder structure.\nFigure 3: Stakeholder structure, \"bicycle-wheel\" model\n\n- 34 -\n\nResource dependence analysis\nFrooman goes on and proposes a theory to determine the type of influence strategies stakeholders\nuse based on resource dependence theory. A resource is essentially something an actor perceives\nas valuable, whereas dependence is a state in which one actor relies on the actions of another to\nachieve particular outcomes. This theory states that because organizations are not self-contained\nor self-sufficient they must rely on others (stakeholders) to gain access to the resources necessary\nto perform the firm activities. In return for the contribution of those resources stakeholders\ntypically will demand certain actions from the organization. This mutual resource dependence\nprovides actors in a relationship with a power attribute that can be used to measure the influence\nof one actor over the other. If actor A depends on actor B for the contribution of a resource\nmore than B depends on A for the retributions, then actor B has more power or the ability to\ninfluence over the A. Then, power or influence is defined in relative terms.\nActors providing resources to a firm have two ways of influencing it: (1) determining whether the\nfirm gets the resources it needs and (2) controlling the quantity of that resource the actor is willing\nto provide to the firm. Also, the pathway of influence can be direct or indirect, depending on\nwhether the resource provision is managed with the firm in a straightforward manner or it is\ncontrolled via third parties.\nStakeholder networks\nThe recognition of the fact that stakeholders can indirectly exert elements of power over an\norganization talks about the existence of interdependence among certain or even all the firm's\nstakeholders.\nRowley (1997) goes beyond the analysis of dyadic relationships between individual stakeholders\nand firms and analyzes the impact on firms' behavior of multiple and interdependent stakeholder\ninteractions using a social network approach that allows studying the characteristics of stakeholder\nsystems' structures. According to Rowley, \"firms do not simply respond to each stakeholder\nindividually; they respond, rather, to the interaction of multiple influences from the entire\nstakeholder set.\" Also, he recognizes that the firm under analysis (focal organization) can also be a\n\n- 35 -\n\nstakeholder of other firms; hence, the firm is not necessarily at the center of the network. The\nsame is true for each one of the stakeholders; each one having its own set of relationships with\nother stakeholders. It is evident then that whenever we analyze the stakeholders' structure we\ntypically find a complex system of relationships organized in the form of a network.\n\ndepicts an example of such a network where circles are drawn representing different\norganizations, which are connected by arcs representing some form of relationship.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4: Network of Stakeholders\n\nThe power and influence characteristics of the stakeholders system reside in the network of\nrelationships rather than in individual actors on that network. By analyzing a stakeholder's\nnetwork structure we will be able to determine how the nature and attributes of the relationships\nimpacts on the behavior of each one of the actors and the network as a whole system.\nThe Ladder of Stakeholder Loyalty\nPolonsky, Schuppisser, and Beldona (2002) studied the different types of relationships that may\nexist between stakeholders. According to their view there exists a range of possibilities in the type\nof relationships stakeholders maintain, from very negative to very positive type of relationships.\nBased on the work by Tuominen they state that firms attempt to classify relationships with their\nstakeholders in a \"ladder of stakeholder loyalty\". In this ladder model stakeholders are classified\naccording to the level of support each one provides to the firm. For instance, we find, in\ndecreasing order of support, advocating, supporting, regular, new, and potential stakeholders.\n\n- 36 -\n\nRelying on the complexity of relationships among stakeholders, Polonsky, Schuppisser, and\nBeldona go on to expand this ladder of stakeholder loyalty to consider negative type of\nrelationships, like the ones typically maintained with competitor groups. Competitors need to be\nconsidered as since they typically have legitimate interests in the results of an enterprise's value\ncreation processes. Competitors are also affected by the actions the enterprise develops in the\nmarketplace where they also have established their operations.\nIn addition, Polonsky et al. list and explain the factors that normally influence in firm-stakeholder\nrelationships and how those factors determine the position of each stakeholder in the ladder of\nloyalty. Among those factors we find:\nRelationship orientation. This factor refers to the motivation each party in a relationship has to\nbe willing to be involved with the other party. It also considers how each party evaluates the\nrelationship. The motivation can be a cooperative, individualistic, or competitive relationship\norientation. In a cooperative relationship orientation the stakeholder considers both its own\ninterests and those of the other party in the relationship. An individualistic orientation means that\nthe stakeholder is only interested in obtaining the best value from the relationship for itself, not\nconsidering the gains or loses of the other party. A competitive orientation is similar to an\nindividualistic one but in this case the stakeholder is also willing to defeat the other party.\nIn terms of the evaluation of the relationship a stakeholder can either consider it strategic or\noperational. A strategic relationship is one that potentially produces long-term benefits whereas an\noperational relationship is one in which the parties pursue more short-term type of objectives.\nTrust. This factor affecting stakeholder relationships is defined by Polonsky et al. as \"the\nwillingness of one party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party\" They distinguish three\nforms of trust: calculus-based, knowledge-based, and identification-based. In calculus-based trust\nthe parties are able to measure and control the costs and benefits associated with the relationship\n(e.g. contractual relationships) hence both parties can rely on that controllability. In knowledge-\nbased trust the parties have got to know each other in such a way that both can discern and\n\n- 37 -\n\npredict the actions of the other. Identification-based trust exists when the parties thoroughly\nunderstand, agree with and endorse each other's intentions and goals. Each party can act as if it\nwhere the other.\nCommunication. The communication factor is essential for establishing any kind of relationship\nbetween stakeholders and is characterized by its frequency, direction, modality, and content. A\nmore collaborative type of relationship will be defined by a higher communication frequency, bi-\ndirectionality, informality, and indirect content. On the other hand, more autonomous\nstakeholders will communicate less frequently, using more unidirectional information flows, more\nformally, and using direct requests.\nLearning. This relational factor accounts for the learning opportunity the relationship offers to\nthe parties in terms of how actions affect one, both, or the relationship between them. There\ntypically exists a learning cycle where goals are conceived, actions to achieve them are planned,\nthen carried out, outcomes are experienced, and finally results are evaluated. The results of these\noften repeated learning cycles usually produce errors hence create learning opportunities.\nDepending on the level with which the parties are willing to change and correct their actions so\ndoes it is the level of learning. These levels can be defined as single-loop, double-loop, and triple-\nloop action-learning. In single-loop action-learning only the actions to achieve the goals are\nrevised. In double-loop action-learning also the goals are revised. And in triple-loop action-\nlearning each party is also willing to change some organizational objectives in order to attain the\nrevised goals.\nPower. This factor is equivalent to that defined by Mitchell et al. (1997) as we have already\ndescribed in previous sections.\nReciprocity and Commitment. A party commits itself to a relationship when it demonstrates\ninterest in the relationship and also consistent future behavior. Reciprocity involves the type of\nreactions of one party to the actions of the other. Positive reciprocity is found when good actions\n\n- 38 -\n\nare repaid with good actions, and negative reciprocity is found when bad actions are repaid with\nbad actions.\nBased on all the above-defined attributes Polonsky et al. define the ladder of stakeholder loyalty as\nit is presented in\n. These definitions will be used later on in this thesis to conceptualize a\nqualitative model for representing stakeholder systems.\nTable 3\n\n- 39 -\n\nTable 3: Ladder of Stakeholder Loyalty\nReciprocity and\ncommitment\nPositive and weak\nHigh commitments\nPositive and weak/\nStrong\nLimited\ncommitments\nPositive/Negative\nand strong\nLow/no\ncommitments\nNegative and strong\nLow commitments\nNegative and strong\nLow/High\ncommitments\nPower\nVery low\nHigher\nNormative\nHigh\nNormative/\nUtilitarian\nHigh\nUtilitarian/\nNormative\n\nVery High\nUtilitarian/\nNormative/\nCoercive\nLearning\nSingle-loop\nDouble-loop\nTriple-loop\nSingle-loop\nDouble-loop\nSingle-loop\nSingle-loop\nSingle-loop\nCommunication\nHi frequency\nBi-directional\nInformal\nIndirect content\nHi frequency\nBi-directional\nInformal\nIn-/direct content\nLow frequency\nBi-directional\nFormal\nDirect content\nLow frequency\nUnidirectional\nFormal\nDirect content\nLow/high freq.\nUni-/Bidirectional\nIn-/Formal\nDirect content\nTrust\nIdentification\n-based trust\nKnowledge-\nbased trust\nCalculus-\nbased trust\nCalculus-\nbased trust\nDistrust\nRelationship\nOrientation and\nEvaluation Mode\nCooperative\nStrategic\nCooperative\nStrategic\n\nIndividualistic\nOperative\nIndividualistic/\nCompetitive\nOperative\nCompetitive\nOperative\nRelationship\nType\nAllied\nCooperative\nNeutral\nCompetitive\nThreatening\n\n- 40 -\n\nC H A P T E R 4\nSUPPORTING THEORIES\nThis chapter presents elements of different supporting theories and practices that will help in\nsetting the basis of our stakeholder analysis frameworks and methodologies.\nSocial Networks\nFrom the descriptions and definitions given in the previous chapters it can be easily interpreted\nthat stakeholders and firms form a social structure where the set of relationships define a network\nof ties among them. Hence the concepts behind Social Networks are appealing to be applied to\nthe study of stakeholder systems. Social networks theory provides a set of definitions and\nquantitative measures that will aid in recognizing the structure of stakeholder networks.\nRelations or ties among actors are the fundamental components and object of study of social\nnetworks theories and practices. Social networks allows for the application of a systemic view to\nthe problem of stakeholder analysis. Some of the principles guiding social network analysis are the\nfollowing: 10\n3⁄4 Actors and their actions are interdependent rather than independent units\n3⁄4 Links between actors are channels for the flow of resources of any type\n3⁄4 Network models visualize the network structural environment as providing\nopportunities or constraints for the actions of each one of the actors in the\nnetwork\n3⁄4 Network models conceptualize structure (social, economic, political, and so forth)\nas lasting patterns of relations among actors\n\n10 see Wasserman and Faust, 1994\n\n- 41 -\n\nThese social networks characteristics match perfectly with the type of analysis we like to perform\nas part of this thesis work. Fundamental to this appropriateness is the focus of social network\nanalysis on the relationships between the constituents of the network. The behavior of each\ncomponent of the network will surely affect the behavior of many other actors in the network and\nmost likely the behavior of the entire network structure. Stakeholder structures, as a social\nstructure they are, are not different from this description; the actions of one stakeholder may very\nwell influence on the reactions of many other stakeholders in the system. In short, one needs a\nnetwork viewpoint to fully understand the behavior of the stakeholder system.\nA social network is defined as a set of actors and the links or relationships among them.\nRelational links among actors are the primary set of data whereas the attributes of actors are\nsecondary. Some of the key concepts of social network analysis are: actors, relational ties, dyads,\ntriads, subgroups, groups, relations, and social network.\nActors are the social entities that form the structure of relationships in a social network. They can\nbe discrete individual, corporate, or collective social units. Examples of actors are people in a\nworking group, functional departments, communities, companies, or national/international\norganizations.\nRelational ties are the elements linking any pair of actors. The type of ties can be quite extensive\nbeing the most common in network analysis the following:\n3⁄4 Individual evaluations (for example expressed friendship, liking or respect)\n3⁄4 Transaction or transfer of material resources (for example buyer-seller or supplier-\nproducer relationships)\n3⁄4 Transfer of non-material resources (for example communications, sending/receiving\ninformation)\n3⁄4 Association or affiliation (for example belonging to an industry working group)\n\n- 42 -\n\n3⁄4 Behavioral interaction - physical presence of two actors in the same place at the same\ntime (for example actors attending to the same social events)\n3⁄4 Physical connection (sharing of an office space or recreation areas)\n3⁄4 Formal roles (for example authority or hierarchies)\n3⁄4 Kinship relationship (marriage, descent)\nA dyad is the most basic level of relationship that can be established between two actors. The link\nis a property of both actors and hence it cannot be thought as pertaining to one individual actor, it\nis something that is recognized by both parties. The link between two actors can be multiple,\nmeaning that there can be more than one type of relational tie relating those two actors.\nA triad is a connection among three actors, although not necessarily complete (each actor linked\nwith the other two) and it basically inherits the basic properties of dyad except in this case there\nare three actors involved in the relationship. The study of triads allows for analyzing transitive\nrelationships of the type \"if actor A influences on actor B, and actor B influences actor C, then\nactor A will also influence actor C\".\nAny subset of actors and their relationships - dyads and triads - can be defined as a subgroup.\nLocating subgroups or clusters of actors and the influence they exert on the social network of\nactors is a key property that allows discovering behavioral patterns in that network.\nA group of actors is defined as a finite set of actors on which the network analysis is going to be\nperformed. A group defines the boundaries of the network system. A method to determine the\nboundaries of the actors set - being it theoretical, empirical, or conceptual is necessary to properly\ndefine a group on which to perform network measurements.\nA relation is the collection of ties of specific kind among the members of a group. For the same\ngroup of actors we can measure the network through many different relations. A relation refers to\nthe collection of ties of a certain type among the actors of a group. The ties themselves always\nbelong to a pair of actors.\n\n- 43 -\n\nWith all the above definitions we can provide a more formal statement for what constitute a social\nnetwork. A social network consists of a finite set or sets of actors and the relation or relations\ndefined among them. The existence of relational information is the defining feature of a social\nnetwork.\nThe analysis of a social network requires the study of the ties among the actors. However, the\nattributes of the actors themselves may also be considered into the analysis. Measurements on\nactors' attributes are referred to as network composition. For example, for stakeholder analysis we\nmight want to measure profitability, revenues, geographical location, interests, prominence, and so\nforth.\nNetwork analyses can be performed at different levels of aggregation: individual actors, dyads,\ntriads, subgroups, and groups (whole network). This is a distinctive property of social network\nanalysis that fits perfectly with stakeholder systems because in enterprise settings one might want\nto concentrate the analysis only in specific aspects of the value creation processes. For example,\nwe might want to analyze how a particular group of suppliers of a firm affects the behavior of the\nrest of the enterprise system.\nThere exist a myriad of metrics and methods associated with social networks analysis. The\nmajority of them allows for discovering structural patterns, i.e. how actors are organized in a\nsocial network. It is the belief of social network theorists that structure informs about the\npotential behavior of the network. Most of the methods provided by social network analysis are\nbased on graph theory that, in turn, relies in matrix operation techniques.\nAmong the most important measurements of social networks are different ways of determining\nthe centrality of actors in the network. Centrality measures inform about the relative structural\nposition or importance of each actor in the network. The idea is that more central actors maintain\nmore relationships, or control the relationships of other actors in the network. Less central or\nperipheral actors need other actors to access different parts of the network. Hence more central\nactors are more relevant for the functionality of the whole social network while less central actors\n\n- 44 -\n\nare less important or secondary for the behavior of the network. We will cover the specifics of\ncentrality metrics in our chapter on stakeholder network analysis.\nComplexity Theory\nWe have stated before that stakeholders form a complex system of relationships. It is then useful\nto introduce some elements of complexity theory that will help in describing some of the\nattributes of stakeholder networks. The field of complexity theory is still under development but\nthere exist a number of properties that are common to every complex system. We will shortly\ndescribe some of these properties and will relate each one of them to stakeholder analysis.\nBar-Yam (1997) defines a complex system as a system formed out of many elements whose\nfunction or behavior is emergent in the sense that function cannot be interpreted from the simple\nanalysis of the behavior of its elements. Then, in every complex system it is important to study\nhow parts of a system affect the collective behavior of the system, and how the system interacts\nwith its surrounding environment. The field of complex systems focuses on certain questions\nabout parts, wholes and relationships. These characteristics are important to many areas of study\nand so they are for stakeholder systems.\nWe can mention here several properties common to all complex systems that can be particularly\ninterpreted for stakeholder systems:11\nInteractions in complex systems are typically nonlinear. Nonlinearities in complex systems are responsible\nfor chaotic behavior. The number of attributes types and forms defining relationships between\nthe stakeholders of any enterprise produces a combined effect that cannot be interpreted simply\nby studying the characteristics of individual relationships. It is the combination of relationships\nand their dynamics that will define the response of the stakeholder system to internal or external\nforces.\n\n11 see Baranger M., no date\n\n- 45 -\n\nConstituents of complex systems are interdependent. In every complex system there exists a sort of\nsymbiosis among its elements. Separating one or several of those elements from the system will\nnormally produce a strong impact on the whole system. This is particularly true for stakeholder\nsystems where the removal of some key stakeholder (e.g. an allied supplier) may profoundly affect\nthe ability of the enterprise system to deliver value to other stakeholders in the network.\nStructure in complex systems is found at several different scales. This property is indicative of some sort of\ngranularity in every complex system. When delving into the details of the components of a\ncomplex system it is common to find elements of structure inside them. In other words, zooming\ninto each component reveals the existence of a lower level of interrelated elements. For\nstakeholders systems this property is represented by the fact that, when zooming inside a\nparticular stakeholder, we will typically find organizational structures (business units, teams,\nworking groups). Inside those organizational structures, and zooming one more level down, we\nwill find smaller teams or individuals that interrelate to produce some sort of value for the level\nabove. This is an important property for stakeholder systems because it allows for understanding\nthe different levels at which the analysis of stakeholders can be done. For example, the analysis\ncan focus exclusively on the value created by some specific product of an enterprise, or more\nbroadly, on the integrated enterprise and its whole line of products and services.\nComplex systems are capable of emergent behavior. We have stated before that the behavior of a complex\nsystem is the result of the interactions among the elements of the system. Behavior or\nfunctionality typically emerges at a particular system scale from the interactions of elements at the\nscale below that. Interactions among stakeholders in different subgroups produce results for other\nsubgroups belonging to the enterprise. For example, supply chains organized in n-tiers schemes\nproduce physical parts or components that another stakeholder in the enterprise will later\nintegrate into a final product. By considering the stakeholder system as a whole we can infer\nwhich is the emergent value pursued by the whole enterprise, not just the value pursued by\nindividual or subgroups of stakeholders. This emergent system level value will help us\ndetermining the boundaries of the enterprise system and identifying potential stakeholders within\nthose boundaries.\n\n- 46 -\n\nComplexity involves interplay between cooperation and competition. This phenomenon usually occurs\nbecause of interacting system scales. Competition at certain scale is fed by cooperation at a scale\nbelow that. This can be exemplified in stakeholder systems by the typical stakeholder coalitions\nformed against competitors entering or pressuring in the market place where the enterprise\noperates. Stakeholders align themselves cooperatively in order to compete in a shared market\nenvironment with similar enterprises.\nGame Theory\nLike many other managerial strategic, tactical, and operational practices Game Theory origins and\nideas come from a war setting. It was during World War II when the British discovered an\nanalytical rather than an intuitive way of moving their war resources in the battlefields, although\nthe theory itself came as such later when John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern developed\nand documented it thoroughly. Game Theory proved to transform many fields of study like\neconomics, politics, social studies, and even evolutionary biology.\nOriginally game theory dealt with zero-sum games where there is always an actor that wins and an\nactor that loses - the typical desired situation in a war scenario. Later on the theory developed\nfully to cover positive-sum games best known as win-win situations.\nGame theory is useful for the analysis of stakeholder management practices because \"[it] is\nparticularly effective when there are many interdependent factors and no decision can be made in\nisolation from a host of other decisions.\"12 It is particularly useful in such complex scenarios\nbecause it allows for decomposing the problem into its key components.\nGame theory in the context of stakeholder analysis allows for determining where the power\nresides in the stakeholders' structure. It permits determining which components of the\nstakeholder structure have the most bargaining power that allows them to control the use of\nresources in the enterprise system. Game theory is all about determining which player posses the\nmost powerful position that allows him or her to control the game.\n\n- 47 -\n\nGame theory is appealing to apply to stakeholder analysis because it explicitly considers the values\nadded and obtained by each player in a game. As we have mentioned before, when analyzing\nstakeholders we have to consider how they affect or how they are affected by the value creation\nactions and decisions implemented by the whole enterprise system. Thus the concepts behind\ngame theory fit naturally for value creation analysis in complex stakeholders' settings.\nDeveloped from game theory, the now popular Nash Equilibrium theory roughly states that, no\nmatter how complex the economic or social scenario is, in a game-like situation involving many\nparticipants there is always a set of negotiation states and strategies where everyone involved in\nthe game is satisfied with the payoffs obtained from it.13 In other words, there always exists a set\nof mixed strategies for each player in the game that maximizes the payoffs each one can obtain\nfrom the game.14\nIn an enterprise scenario, which can be associated with a game scenario, stakeholders are the\nplayers. Each one of them will typically devise its business strategies in order to obtain the\nmaximum benefits from the enterprise independently of the degree of collaboration and\ncooperation they offer to the other participants in the enterprise. But according to Nash's\nequilibrium theory they will obtain a maximum payoff from the execution of those strategies.\nThis is equivalent to say that at certain steady state the value each stakeholder will obtain from the\nenterprise will be maximal. Consequently, if we assume that what flows in the relationship\nbetween any two stakeholders is value (payoffs from stakeholders' contributions to the enterprise)\nthen these values will be in equilibrium. This means that their relationship is balanced in the sense\nthat the value flowing in one direction is compensated by the value flowing in the other direction,\ni.e. no \"value tensions\" exists in the relationship. For example, in a supplier-producer relationship\nthe supplier provides goods to the producer and in return he obtains a fair monetary payoff.\nValue for the supplier is the benefit obtained from revenues coming from the producer once the\n\n12 see Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1998\n13 John Nash proved this theory in a 27 pages Ph.D. thesis masterpiece in 1950. Later, in 1994, this work allowed him to win the\nNobel Prize in Economics.\n14 Nash J., 'Non-Cooperative Games' paper in Kuhn H.W. and Nasar S., 2002\n\n- 48 -\n\ncost of the manufactured goods and other associated costs have been discounted. Value for the\nproducer is represented by the proportional monetary benefits obtained from the final product\ndue to the supplied component once the cost of that component has been deducted. If the\nnegotiation process resulted in a fair value for both parties then the relationship is in equilibrium.\nThe assumption that stakeholders maintain balanced valued relationships will be one of our\nstrongest assumptions throughout the rest of this thesis.\n\n- 49 -\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n- 50 -\n\nC H A P T E R 5\nSTAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS MODELS\nThis chapter presents qualitative frameworks to analyze relationships and structures in stakeholder\nsystems. Two different frameworks are introduced: a firm-centric model, and a network model of\nstakeholder systems. In Chapter 7 we will present an example using both models.\nA Tale of Two Donkeys\nThe well-known children's story The Tale of Two Donkeys will help us in illustrating the\nfundamentals of our stakeholder analysis frameworks.15\nTwo hungry donkeys are tied together when suddenly they both see some food. One\nsees a bundle of hay at the bottom of the field and the other sees a bundle of hay at the\ntop.\n\nThey both begin to walk in opposite directions towards the food they have seen.\nSlowly the rope that ties them together unwinds and becomes tighter and tighter until\nthey cannot move towards the sweet smelling hay any more. Each donkey begins to\npull as hard as she can towards the hay. The more they pull, the angrier and angrier\nthey become.\n\nEventually, they are so tired that they sit down in the middle of the field in despair.\nSuddenly, one of the donkeys has an idea -- she knows how they can both eat. All\nthey need to do is work together.\n\n15 Text and pictures obtained from http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/\n\n- 51 -\n\nFirst, they go to one bundle of hay and share it....\n\n...then they walk to the other bundle and they are both well fed.\n\nAs one can easily imagine the fundamental lesson behind this story is the advantage of a\ncooperative relationship. Cooperation means two or more parties working together to find the\nsolution to a problem.16 The problem for the donkeys is how to eat all the hay they can even\nwhen restricted by the length of the rope. To obtain the most value (hay) out of a constraining\nrelationship (rope) the donkeys must think of ways of working around that constraint. They can\ndo that unilaterally, but most likely this approach will end in competitive efforts to obtain the\ndesired value. This is donkeys' first attempt. Alternatively, both can think together of a way to\nsolve the problem, which they nicely do in this case.\nVery much like these two starving donkeys the relationships between stakeholders many times\nresults in competition for the use of some resource or the extraction of value from the business.\nIn many of these cases maintaining cooperative relationships possibly signify a more efficient\n\n16 The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines cooperation as \"the combination of a number of persons, or of a community, for\npurposes of economic production or distribution\"\n\n- 52 -\n\nutilization of resources or an increased value (a win-win type of relationship) obtained from the\nsystem. Consider, for instance, a constrained relationship between a producer and a key supplier\nwhere a binding contract specify the quantities of certain parts to be monthly delivered by the\nlatter. If the producer wants to buy less of those parts in a certain month due to a reduction in\nthe demand of the final product the contract will limit that transaction. The supplier will want to\nstay on the safe side and deliver the quantities stipulated in the contract. In this case the contract\nis the limiting factor in the relationship making both parties to work inefficiently. If a cooperative\ntype of relationship would exist instead then more predictable demand from the producer and\nbetter lead times from the supplier can be accomplished.\nNaturally, if the rope in the two donkeys' tale is of such a length that both donkeys can eat from\nboth bundles of hay simultaneously then the limiting relationship disappears, and so does the\nneed for cooperation. These are the cases where the amount of resources or the value obtained\nfrom the relationship is enough to amply satisfy both parties. Following on with our example, if\nthe component a producer requires from the supplier is a commodity (e.g. nuts and bolts) then\nthe producer may well buy from different suppliers in the case, for example, of a positive variation\nin demand of the final product. Similarly, the supplier is free to sell the same type of components\nto many different customers so does diversifying the risks of a single commercial relationship. In\nthis case supply contracts or even simple opportunistic transactions are enough to guarantee a\ngood relationship between the parties and the creation of value for the enterprise. There is no\nneed for collaboration schemes between the parties.\nAn intermediate case in the tale would be one in which the rope is of just the right length to allow\neach donkey to barely reach one of the bundles of hay. In this case both will be able to eat some\nfood at the same time but soon they will start to compete to eat the rest of their corresponding\nheap. Although they will eat some food they can do better if they think in a semi-\ncooperative/competitive alternative to solve the problem. For example, they can agree to eat in\nturns from their corresponding bundle of hay. In our producer-supplier example a relationship of\nthis type might be one in which the market conditions are just enough to guarantee adequate\ndemand of parts to sustain the supplier business. The supplier can work in cooperation with the\n\n- 53 -\n\nproducer to promote the sales of the end product or the producer can help the supplier to find\nalternative applications for his products in order to expand the business opportunities for both\nparties.\nAnother possible scenario in the donkey's tale is that of a totally competitive relationship. This\nwould be the case, for instance, of another animal (e.g. a bull) tied to the other end of the rope. It\nis unlikely that these two animals will be willing to cooperate. Nevertheless, even in this case each\nparty needs to understand the needs and motivations of the other in order to be able to think of\ncreative solutions to solve the problem. They need to understand that the interests of each one are\ntied to the interests of the other. In a stakeholder environment there are plenty of cases similar to\nthis example. For example, consider the role of a competitor of the producer, one that produces\nsimilar products for the same market. Eventually, both parties will be sharing a portion of the\nmarket but it is the responsibility of both parties together to make that market grow in order to\nobtain further gains from the business.\nLike in the tale, the relationships between any two stakeholders in an enterprise may tighten\nbecause both parties compete while trying to use resources more efficiently or to create more\nvalue from the relationship. Stakeholders must be aware of the needs of other actors in the system\npromoting collaborative relationships that would enhance the value they can obtain from the\nenterprise efforts. It is hardly the case that collaborative relationships are needed with every\nstakeholder in the enterprise system, but more typical with some selected actors that demonstrate\na win-win or strategic attitude towards the enterprise.\nIn summary, a system of stakeholder relationships needs to be evaluated in cooperative terms in\norder to relax the tensions produced in the whole system by scarce resources and limited value\ncreation opportunities. A cooperative vision of the enterprise will help producing better results\nfrom the value creation strategies.\n\n- 54 -\n\nThe Dual View\nThe donkey's situation can be analyzed from two distinct points of view. On the one hand, the\nproblem can be visualized from the perspective of any one of the two donkeys, in an egocentric\nmanner. This viewpoint will allow any of the donkeys to think primarily in terms of her needs -\nhow fast can she reach and eat her bundle of hay. Although \"donkey-centered\" this view does not\nignore the fact of the existence of another donkey, the rope that ties them together, and the other\nbundle of hay. Each donkey needs to consider those elements in order to solve her problem, but\nunder this viewpoint they do that to evaluate the consequences on her particular needs. On the\nother hand, the problem can be analyzed from a more systemic perspective, considering all the\ndifferent elements in the context and analyzing their interdependence. This rather external view\nwould allow for a more balanced analysis of the possible outcomes, one that evaluates which are\nthe gains and loses of each particular solution strategy from a more cooperative perspective.\nSimilarly, the analysis of stakeholder systems requires, like every other complex system, the use of\nmany different views and their related models in order to attain a complete description of the\nsystem attributes and characteristics.17 We propose here two different models, both aimed at\nslightly different managerial objectives. Both models are complementary in nature hence defining\na duality concept: each one of the models informs on some of the characteristics of the other,\nboth are necessary to obtain a complete picture of the system. Managerial actions need from both\nmodels to come up with solutions that produce better results by considering stakeholders from\nthe firm vantage point, and at the same time, assure that all the stakeholders get adequate payoffs\n(value) from their contributions to the enterprise system.\nThe first model is a firm-centric model that can be used to qualitatively measure the consequences\non a firm's performance objectives coming from the relationship with its stakeholders. For\nexample, this model would allow identifying which stakeholders need to be closer to the firm to\n\n17 Maier and Rechtin (2002) define a model as \"an approximation, representation, or idealization of selected aspects of the structure,\nbehavior, operation, or other characteristics of a real-world process, concept, or system.\", and a view as \"a representation of a\nsystem from the perspective of related concerns or issues.\"\n\n- 55 -\n\nincrease opportunities of successfully entering in a new market or to implement distinctive growth\nstrategies.\nThe second qualitative model we propose in this thesis is a network or system model, which\ninvolves the analysis of the detailed relationships among all stakeholders. This model can be used,\nfor instance, to balance the needs and value propositions offered to all or some particular group\nof stakeholders, and to predict system's behavior when implementing policies that affect part or\nthe whole stakeholder system.\nWater-Drop Model\nA stakeholder system's water-drop model represents a way of depicting different type of\nrelationships among stakeholders and a focal firm in an enterprise. This model is based on some\nof the characteristics of stakeholder theory presented in Chapter 3, particularly in the concepts\npresented in \"the ladder of stakeholder loyalty\". It also relies on the descriptions and examples\npresented in the previous section title. Figure 5 presents an example of a water-drop model. We\nwill use this figure to explain the details of the model.\nThe water-drop model represents a stakeholder system as a firm-centric view of an enterprise\nwhere a focal organization assumes the role of concentrator of all the constituents of that\nenterprise. Because typically the initial efforts to map out a stakeholder system will come from a\nparticular organization in the system it is interesting to present a model that depicts how\nstakeholders are organized around that organization. This model will be useful for that\norganization to determine, for instance, which stakeholders (once they are identified) maintain a\ncooperative relationship with the firm.\nAnother characteristic of this model is that it allows for representing both internal and external\nstakeholders. Different groups, divisions, and business units within a company are also\nstakeholders of the firm, ones very close to it, and as such they are represented in the center of\nthe figure. The model as it is presented in the figure is merely an example of the type of\nstakeholders that can exist around a firm, and or the relationships that the firm maintains with\n\n- 56 -\n\nthem. It does not pretend to represent a full picture of the universe of possible stakeholders\nneither of all the possible type of relationships among them.\nHighly collaborative relationships are depicted as overlapping 'drops' (ellipses) that mean to\nindicate that the relationship is very cooperative in nature and based on trust between the parties.\nThe overlapping degree intends to represent the level of cooperation and collaboration between\nthe parties. Communications between the parties serve the purpose of coordinating the activities\nand strategies to achieve common goals and are typically frequent and informal. The relationship\nis evaluated as strategic by both parties, which means that the ultimate purpose of the relationship\nis the achievement of long-term goals. The level of commitment in the relationship is high due to\nits strategic importance for both parties. The actions and attitudes of one party are reciprocated\nwith similar or enhanced actions and are always aiming at win-win type of relationship. None of\nthe parties need to exert power over the other to perform value creation actions or to achieve\nenterprise's objectives. The relationship allows for cultivating learning opportunities for both the\nfirm and the stakeholder. This situation in the water-drop model corresponds to the allied\nstakeholder type we have described in the ladder of stakeholder loyalty section in Chapter 3.\nA relationship where collaboration is present but with less degree or intensity than in the\npreviously described type is represented in the water-drop model with two drops connected with\na 'water neck'. In this case there exist some degree of coordination and communication but the\nrelationship is evaluated by both parties more as a short-term or operative type of relationship.\nThe length of the water-neck represent degrees or levels in those collaboration and coordination\nefforts - a longer water-neck (analogous to two water drops that are about to split) is indicative of\na less cooperative relationship. This is cases are equivalent to the cooperative or even neutral\nstakeholders we have described in Chapter 3.\n\n- 57 -\n\nFigure 5: Stakeholder system - Water drop model\n\n- 58 -\n\nRelationships that involve more formal transactions or exchanges are represented by double or\nsimple arrows depending on whether the relationship is bidirectional or unidirectional. In a formal\ntransaction it is unusual to evaluate the relationship in terms of strategic or long-term visions.\nInstead, a cost-benefit case-by-case type of analysis is performed every time a relationship of this\nkind is established or reevaluated. This analysis helps each party in assessing the convenience of\nthe relationship in terms of the cost and risk associated with the relationship and the benefits that\ncan be obtained from it. If the balance is positive for both parties then the relationship is\nestablished but it will always be measured from an individualistic point of view. No further gains\nor long-term opportunities are expected from the relationship. Relationship commitment in these\ncases is guided by some type of contract or agreement, which, once completed, can be\nreestablished if the relationship still shows to be convenient for both parties. When the contract is\nfinished there will be typically an evaluation process where past performances and new objectives\nare considered in order to assess the convenience of continuing with the relationship.\nDisconnected drops in the water-drop model represent dormant, latent, or competitive\nstakeholders. Competitive stakeholders are those that pursue an individualistic type of relationship\nand at the same time try to undermine the objectives of the firm influencing the stakeholder\nsystem by applying different power exertion schemes. In essence, a competitive stakeholder builds\nits own set of relationships (water-drop system) to outperform the firm under analysis. A\ncompetitor then is graphically represented as a 'water bubble' indicating the existence of another\nstakeholder system that influence on the firm under analysis.\nDormant or latent stakeholders are those that were identified as potential influencers in the\nenterprise, those that have some claim or an interest at stake, but that for some reason - usually\nlow power, legitimacy, and/or criticality - they stay expectant but observant of the enterprise\nactions and evolution. These type of stakeholders need to be represented in the model because,\npotentially, they can become active stakeholders if their stakes or interests get compromised by\nthe actions of the firm or other stakeholders in the enterprise system.\n\n- 59 -\n\nThe water-drop model also intends to represent the fact that primary stakeholders also have a set\nof stakeholders linked to them that can potentially influence on the firm under analysis. We say\nthat the model is recursive or fractal in the sense that for each of the firm's primary stakeholder\nthe types of relationships they maintain with their own stakeholders are of the same nature as\nthose found at the first level of analysis. Hence we depict these secondary relationships as mini\nwater-drop systems connected to the main firm representation.\nLastly, the water drop analogy gives the model certain sense of dynamism. In fact, relationships\nand stakeholders are usually in constant evolution hence the necessity to constantly reevaluate\nwho the firm's stakeholders are and what type of relationship they maintain with the focal\norganization.\nA generic example\nThe example presented in the water-drop model of\nrepresents an investor-based type of\ncompany where certain production process requires of a set of different suppliers and the\nproducts produced are sold to different types of customers. Other relevant stakeholders in this\nenterprise include shareholders (private and public), unions, partner companies and funding\norganizations. Secondary or less relevant stakeholders include the news media, society in general,\ndifferent governmental levels, end users, and consumers. Competitors operating in the same\nmarketplace are also represented as stakeholders as they can affect or be affected by the value\ncreation processes of the company under analysis.\nFigure 5\nAllied suppliers are those that maintain a highly collaborative relationship with the enterprise as\ndescribed above thus represented as an overlapping water-drop with that of the focal firm. These\nallied suppliers in turn have their own set of relationships with second-tier suppliers and many\nother stakeholders. The type of relationships they maintain with them can be any of the different\ntypes described above in terms of levels of collaboration and cooperation. Allied suppliers\nmaintain a symbiotic type of relationship with the producer where the actions of any of the actors\ncomplement those of the other both benefiting from that dependency. This is the case, for\nexample, of a first-tier automobile parts supplier where the timeliness and quality of the parts\n\n- 60 -\n\naffect the final product's market success. In turn all marketing actions for the end product are\ncarried out by the focal firm where their success will certainly affect the outputs and the\nsurvivability of those first-tier suppliers. Both parties define a win-win type of relationship one\nthat requires high commitment for its proper maintenance and evolution.\nCooperative suppliers, while still close to the focal firm, view the relationship as less strategic but\nstill perform collaborative and coordinated actions together with the focal firm. They are\nrepresented as a separate drop linked to the firm by a water-neck. Also here second-tier suppliers\nare accommodated according to the type of relationships they maintain with these suppliers.\nCommitment to the relationship is limited as a result of more near-term objectives. Cooperative\nsuppliers understand the business the enterprise is in but they are not essential to its performance,\nthey do not completely depend on the enterprise to survive and the enterprise can count on\nalternate suppliers to obtain the goods or services they supply. Communications tend to be more\nformal, and although frequent, they are limited to specific supply issues and do not include\nstrategic or business development topics.\nNeutral suppliers are those that maintain a contractual or transactional relationship with the\nenterprise. They act individually and independently of the actions of the focal firm and are\ntypically tied to it by means supply contracts. Commodity parts suppliers are characteristic of this\ngroup where the firm can choose from several different suppliers depending on the cost-benefit\nconvenience of the transaction. Neutral suppliers have much less influence on the enterprise that\nallied or cooperative suppliers but they can still form a cluster with enough power to affect the\nfirm results and objectives.\nSeveral types of customer stakeholders are represented in the water-drop model example of\n. The types of relationship that loyal, regular, and occasional customers maintain with the\nfocal firm are parallel to those of allied, cooperative, and neutral suppliers respectively. Loyal\ncustomers are those that obtain further gains by establishing highly collaborative relationship\nagreements with the focal firm. They both know for sure that a long-term buyer-seller relationship\nis convenient because of, for instance, an increasing demand or technological dependency. For\nFigure 5\n\n- 61 -\n\nexample, car dealers in the automobile industry and DOD in the defense aerospace industry are\nboth loyal customers of an auto producer and an aerospace company respectively.\nRegular customers are those that buy the firm's products on a regular basis but they also have\nother sources to obtain identical or similar products. While purchases in this case may still require\nsome coordination due the importance of the transaction, mutual dependence of both customer\nand firm is not that high as for the loyal customers.\nOccasional customers are those that buy the enterprise's products every once in a while either\nbecause they do not need to replace products so often or because they can buy similar products\nfrom other producers. They evaluate the relationship with the enterprise as opportunistic hence\nthey measure the convenience of the relationship strictly from a cost-benefit point of view. Then,\nthe type of relationship they maintain is of transactional or contractual nature. However, a large\nbase of occasional customers can make for a big market opportunity that the enterprise may want\nto exploit in order, for instance, to leverage product development and/or marketing investments.\nConsidering the needs and value proposition for this group of customers can be of vital\nimportance for the viability of the enterprise hence the necessity to represent them in the model.\nPartner companies, unions, and corporate shareholders typically maintain a highly collaborative\nrelationship with the enterprise as their respective goals are tightly coupled with those of the focal\nfirm, and vice versa. While it may appear that unions always are in a position of confrontation\nwith the firm they also understand that the results of the enterprise affect them directly hence at\nsome point in the relationship they need to closely collaborate with the firm to achieve mutual\ngains and objectives.\nThis generic example also depicts different type of competitors participating in the enterprise.\nAmong them we have industry, substitute, and disruptive competitors. They can affect the\nenterprise value creation processes in many different ways. Industry competitors are those that\nbelong to the same industry environment as the focal firm. They offer the same kind of products\nto the same market. Substitute competitors are those that offer alternate products to satisfy\n\n- 62 -\n\ncustomers' needs in the same market hence competing with the focal firm to gain more market\nshare. Disruptive competitors are those that offer disruptive products; those that redefine the\nperformance trajectory of established products and that typically are produced by an outsider\n(entrant firms not belonging to the same industry)18 These three competitor types will capture the\nattention of many of the other stakeholders participating in the enterprise; particularly regular,\noccasional or even loyal customer stakeholders. Hence, it is important to monitor and be aware of\ncompetitors' actions in order to be able to neutralize them by means of more profound\nconsideration of the relationships with actual and potential stakeholders of the enterprise.\nLast but not least are the media, society, and governmental stakeholders. They are represented as\nseparate 'drops' because they tend to behave more as secondary stakeholders; their presence is\nmost of the times of second order relevance with respect of that of primary stakeholders\ndescribed above. Media and society typically trigger their demands towards the enterprise when\nsome business ethics principle is violated. Nurturing the relationships with them can help in\nfuture ventures or when the actions of more powerful stakeholders compromise the image or\nviability of the enterprise. Governmental stakeholders typically have more relevance for the\nstrategies of the enterprise as they can be sources of resources through funding organizations.\nThey can also provide support for the enterprise actions through the provision of protecting laws\nor regulations. Their presence is of such an importance that it is common to find many important\nlobbying organizations representing the interests (stakes) of different enterprises influencing in the\ndecisions of governmental stakeholders at many different levels.\nAs for internal stakeholders one may want to zoom into those to obtain similar representation as\nto those of external stakeholders. The focus in this case is to obtain more details about the type of\nrelationships that exist among different groups inside the focal firm. This model example presents\nall the relationships among internal stakeholders as highly collaborative - each group's 'drop' is\noverlapped with that of the others. This should represent the 'leaner' way of operating the firm;\none in which internal organizational boundaries are resolved based on lean principles and\n\n18 See Christensen C.M,. 2000.\n\n- 63 -\n\npractices. However, it can result from an internal analysis of the firm that certain groups within it\nare not properly integrated thus impeding appropriate cooperation schemes to prosper. It is also\nassumed in the model that one of the most important stakeholders of any firm - the employees -\nconstitute the support base for all the enterprise. While they do not explicitly appear in the water-\ndrop model representation they are thought as being present 'behind' each of the stakeholder\ndrops, at a lower complexity scale (see complexity theory section in Chapter 4).\nAnother important role in the model is that of focal firm's managers and leaders. They must\nprovide a challenging vision for the firm and the necessary impulse to adequately nurture the\nrelationships with each and every stakeholder in the enterprise system.\nNetwork Model\nThe water-drop model provides a firm-centric viewpoint of the enterprise system. This model is\nuseful to managers for them to recognize stakeholders and to analyze their level of integration\nwith the firm. However, the complexity of the relationships among stakeholders calls for a more\nsystem-level representation of the enterprise system; one in which stakeholders and their specific\nrelationships can be explicitly shown. This is the intent of our second qualitative model: the\nNetwork Model.\nIn this model stakeholders are represented as a set of actors and their relationships in a social\nnetwork type of diagram. A hypothetical example of a network model is depicted in\n. This\nrepresentation allows for a qualitative visual analysis of the relative positions of each stakeholder\n(including the focal firm) and the power each one can exert on the whole enterprise system. It\nalso lets us analyze stakeholder's clusters: groups of stakeholders that in combination can\ninfluence other stakeholders and the whole enterprise to perform to their convenience. In short,\nwith a network model representation the structure of the stakeholder system can be easily\nvisualized an interpreted.\nFigure 6\n\n- 64 -\n\nFigure 6: Stakeholder system - Network Model\nIn the network model (see Figure 6) stakeholders are represented by circles and relationships\nbetween stakeholders by lines connecting those circles. Whenever two stakeholders are\nrecognized as maintaining a relationship relevant to the enterprise they are connected by a line.\nThe size (diameter) of circles representing stakeholders is indicative of their salience as it is\nperceived by managers or the person in charge of the analysis. In the next chapter we will develop\na methodology for measuring stakeholders' saliencies based on the attributes of power, legitimacy,\nand criticality we have described in Chapter 3. The result of those measures can be used to\ndetermine the relative size of the circles, but it is also useful to depict them using qualitative or\napproximate salience estimation.\n\n- 65 -\n\nThe width of the lines (relationships) connecting circles (stakeholders) is representative of the\nimportance or relevance of those links to the value creation processes of the whole enterprise.\nThis relationship relevance has to be somehow normalized for each link, i.e. a particular line width\nshould be representative of the relative importance of the link it represents when compared to the\nimportance of every other link in the network. Similarly to stakeholder's salience, in this\nqualitative model the relevance of the relationship can be an estimation or perception of the\nanalyst coming from the observation of the system as a whole. The next chapter will also present\na methodology for measuring relationships' relevancies that can be used to construct better or\nmore representative network models.\nDifferent type of relations can be represented by different line patterns. For instance, an\ninformation flow relationship between any two stakeholders can be depicted using dotted lines\nwhile material, goods, or services transactions and exchanges can be represented with solid lines.\nAnother possibility is to consider relationships where balanced values are considered to be\nflowing between any two stakeholders as we explained in the game theory section in Chapter 5.\nThis is the case we have chosen to represent in\n. In this case there is only one type of\nrelation that can exist in the network, which is defined by the value exchanges between\nstakeholders. Then, line patterns representing relationships are all alike.\nFigure 6\nInstead of representing each stakeholder in arbitrary positions in the diagram we can exploit the\ntwo dimensional space to represent some characteristic of the stakeholder network structure. For\ninstance, we might want to represent stakeholders that belong to a certain affinity group as a\ncluster of circles in a particular region of the diagram. Or we might want to represent in the center\nof the figure those stakeholders that are more relevant for the enterprise value creation processes\nand in the periphery those stakeholders whose influence abilities are not that important. There\nexist in the social network research literature many methods to represent actors in two or even\nthree dimensional spatial depictions. One of the most widely used techniques is called\nMultidimensional Scaling (MDS) (Wassermanm and Faust, 1994; Freeman L., 2000) MDS allows for\ndisplaying the proximities among stakeholders groups in the network. MDS can be used to study\n\n- 66 -\n\ncohesive subgroups showing which subsets of stakeholders are relatively close to each other in an\nenterprise network.\nWhile there exist several ways of performing MDS on a relational data set the most common one\nis MDS based on geodesic distances (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). Using this alternative,\nproximities among stakeholders are defined as the geodesic distances among stakeholders.\nGeodesics are the shortest paths linking any two stakeholders in the network as measured by the\nminimum number of links that need to be traversed to reach one stakeholder starting from one\nanother. The input to the MDS process is a squared matrix of the geodesics between\nstakeholders, row and columns of the matrix corresponding to the stakeholders in the system.\nThen, the process iterates trying to arrange stakeholders in such a way that the distances between\npairs of stakeholders in a two dimensional space correspond to the distances between\nstakeholders in the input matrix. The resulting spatial distribution should display the structure of\nstakeholders in the system.\nAlthough the details of MDS process and calculations are beyond the scope of this thesis we can\nmention here that there exist several software packages that are able to perform multidimensional\nscaling on a set of dichotomous or valued relationships (see Wasserman & Faust, 1994, Freeman\nL., 2000). We will use one of such software packages when we develop our application example's\nmodels in Chapter 7.\nIn summary, the network model allows focusing not only on the constituents of the enterprise -\nits stakeholders, but also on the relationships among them. Using this model the relative salience\nof each stakeholder can be easily analyzed when visually compared to that of others. Also,\nstructural patterns, stakeholder clusters, network connectivity, and other network characteristics\ncan be assessed by visually inspecting this kind of model.\nLean Enterprise Viewpoint\nOne problem that appears when building both type of models is defining the boundaries of the\nsystem, i.e. which stakeholders to include in the network model. Rowley (1997) defines three\n\n- 67 -\n\ndifferent ways of determining which actors to include in a network representation. Citing the\nwork by Knoke, Rowley states that analysts can focus on (1) actor attributes, (2) types of relations\nunder analysis, or (3) a central issue or event providing that motivates the analysis. For\nstakeholder systems an actor attribute corresponds, for example, to the size of organizations in\nterms of annual income and/or number of employees. A relation type can be exemplified by the\ninformation or communication flow across the stakeholder network, or the exchange of goods\nand services among stakeholders. As for central issues in stakeholder networks we find that, for\nthe case of the analysis presented in this thesis, a value creation process of the enterprise under\nanalysis constitutes the most relevant issue to consider when analyzing the implementation of lean\nenterprise initiatives.\nAnother question that typically arises when analyzing stakeholder representation models and its\nassociated data is whether the structure of the stakeholder system is adequate for accomplishing\nthe objectives of the enterprise, i.e. implementing its value creation processes. A lean enterprise\nviewpoint of both models will indicate whether a stakeholder system is more or less lean\ndepending on the existence of tensions between any pair of stakeholders in the network. Tensions\nor frictions are sources of waste in the enterprise; they need to be resolved in order to achieve\nlean enterprise performance. In water-drop models these tensions are characterized by the lack of\ncollaboration or cooperation among stakeholders and the focal firm. In network models tensions\nand inefficiencies correspond to the presence or absence of relationships among the most relevant\nstakeholders in the network. Also, clusters of stakeholders and their associated power may\nconstitute an object of analysis since they can influence in the behavior of the network.\nIn any case, and for each particular enterprise, the set of relationships and stakeholder\ninterdependencies must be carefully analyzed to detect inefficiencies that produce waste and\nhinder the implementation of lean practices. Each enterprise must assess which relationships need\nto be highly collaborative and which ones can be considered as more formal but still influencing\ntransactions. Also, establishing integrative relationships with distant subgroups in the network\nmay help achieving leaner implementations. For each relationship present in the stakeholder\nnetwork its content in terms of the value exchanged between any two stakeholders must be\n\n- 68 -\n\nevaluated. A value analysis of each relationship will allow for detecting unbalances in the\ncoordination activities between those stakeholders and opportunities to implement lean principles\nand practices aimed at resolving value exchange inefficiencies.\n\n- 69 -\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n- 70 -\n\nC H A P T E R 6\nSTAKEHOLDER NETWORK ANALYSIS\nThis chapter presents the development of quantitative and formal methods for stakeholder's\nidentification, salience calculation, and relationship and structure mapping.\nStakeholder Identification Methodology\nThe first step in building any representation of a stakeholder system is to identify which are the\nstakeholders that should be considered for the analysis. This involves two basic steps:\n3⁄4 Identify potential stakeholders\n3⁄4 Determine the salience of those stakeholders to evaluate whether it is reasonable to\nconsider them for the analysis\nThis section covers the first question: who are the potential stakeholders of the enterprise system?\nThe second question will be the subject of analysis of subsequent sections in this chapter.\nWe propose here a methodology for potential stakeholder identification that allows determining\nthe boundaries of the stakeholder system. The method is based on the value generated by the\nstakeholder system (the enterprise) hence it is compatible with our broad definition of\nstakeholders (see Chapter 3) and with the lean enterprise model described in Chapter 2.\nFigure 7 depicts the proposed stakeholder identification process and the following section titles\ndescribe it. The process is based on the 'snowball sampling' methodology described by\nWasserman and Faust (1994: 30-35), which is specially suited for social networks where the\nboundaries of the system are unknown a priori. We have particularized this technique for the case\nof stakeholder identification and added lean enterprise and complex system theory elements to it\nto complete the methodology.\n\n- 71 -\n\nApply Stakeholder\nbroad definition\nLitmus Test\nSelect an already identified\nstakeholder as the new\nFocal Organization\nSelect Inital Focal\nOrganization\nIdentify potential groups or\nsubgroups\nRegister Stakeholder\nand Relationship Type\nand Characteristics\nIs it a potential\nstakeholder?\nAre there more\nstakeholders?\nIdentify Enterprise\nSystem Level Value\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\nFigure 7: Stakeholder Identification Process Flow Diagram\n\n- 72 -\n\nSystem Level Value Identification\nThe stakeholder identification process starts with the definition of the value pursued by the\nenterprise system. This is not the value each particular stakeholder obtains or is willing to obtain\nas a payoff from its contribution to the enterprise. More transcendental than that, this is the system\nlevel value derived from the ultimate objectives of the enterprise system as a whole, and measured\nat the level of analysis we are interested in to study. This system level value can be either\nsubjective, like in the proposition 'promote community welfare', or a more objective one, like 'put\na man on the moon's surface by 1969', but certainly represents the intent of the integrated\nenterprise.\nWhile particular stakeholder's values and stakes will be important in subsequent phases of the\nstakeholder analysis process system level value will help in the analysis of who must be considered\nas a potential stakeholder. In other words, determining the system level value will facilitate\ndefining the boundaries of the enterprise system. In fact, the system level value usually constitutes\nthe driving force for each and every stakeholder participating in the enterprise system, the reason\nwhy they contribute with their efforts in the enterprise.\nThe questions the analyst might want to ask to determine system level value are of the type: what\nis the ultimate intent of the integrated enterprise? What is the reason for being of the enterprise\nsystem? What are the mission and/or vision that define the objectives of enterprise? For the\nreason that this system level value represents the intent of the integrated enterprise it can be\nrepresented by grammatical constructions of the form \"To... by...\"19 An example of this type of\nconstruction is \"TO provide product X in marketplace Y BY implementing process Z.\" The\ngeneral structure is \"To [statement of overall intent] by [statement of process or behavior]\"\nThe system level value can be defined at many different levels of analysis. Each of these levels will\naccount for different sets of stakeholders and different boundaries of the enterprise system. For\ninstance, one can focus on the value created by a particular program, project, or product of an\n\n19 'Ambiguity', lecture notes from MIT's graduate level course ESD.34J \"System Architecture\"\n\n- 73 -\n\nenterprise; or one can focus on more aggregated levels and account for the value delivered by\nmultiple programs that span across different organizations of the enterprise. In any case, the value\nobject of the analysis must be unambiguously specified in order to proceed with the next steps in\nthe process.20\nIn addition, the value pursued by the integrated enterprise can be made up of several different\nsub-values or multiple objectives. The analyst should be aware of these type of multiple goals as\nthey can bring into the enterprise system stakeholders that otherwise would not have been\nconsidered as relevant for the enterprise. For example, a multiple system level value can be to\nprovide certain products for a defined marketplace AND to create employment opportunities in\nthe local community where the enterprise develops its activities. This value statement would allow\nincorporating as stakeholders of the enterprise different NGOs and many governmental entities\nthat are interested in promoting employment in the region.\nInitial Focal Organization\nAfter the system level value has been identified the next step in the process asks for the selection\nof an initial focal organization to start with the identification process. This initial focal\norganization is some recognizable entity within the enterprise system that will serve as the starting\npoint for the identification of stakeholders. This entity is the focal point in which the analyst\nwants to concentrate in each cycle of the stakeholder identification process. The initial focal\norganization can be selected using different criteria such as the size (income, number of\nemployees) of different entities that explicitly participate in the enterprise, their presence or\nrelevance in a particular marketplace, the time they have been participating in the business or\nindustry, or simply because the analyst is interested in a firm-centric type of study. This latter case\nwould be the situation, for instance, of the managers of a firm trying to analyze the relationships\nwith its own particular set of stakeholders.\n\n20 ibid.\n\n- 74 -\n\nGroups Identification\nThis step of the identification process requires the detection of groups, or subgroups that can\npotentially constitute stakeholders of the enterprise system. Here the focus must be put on any\ngroup or subgroup inside or outside any of the organizations that the analyst think can constitute\na potential stakeholder. These groups will be inevitable associated with the system level value\npursued by the enterprise that was identified in the first step of the process. The obvious starting\npoint are known types or categories of stakeholders; primary stakeholders, such as suppliers,\nowners, customers, employees, and competitors; and secondary stakeholders, like government\nagencies, political parties, media, environmental groups, communities, and so forth. Particular\nattention must be put on subgroups that may splinter from those original larger groups as they\ncan constitute independent potential stakeholders.\nFinding relationships of the focal organization with known or explicit types of potential\nstakeholders groups is not a difficult task, but discovering tacit relationships with unperceived\ngroups can be a daunting one. To aid in the process of group identification several methods can\nbe applied. Wasserman and Faust (1997) summarize several of these methods for collecting\nrelationship data. Among them they list questionnaires, interviews, observation, and the study of\narchival records. Submitting questionnaires and conducting interviews with key people inside the\nfocal organization and other external organizations are two of the most used techniques for\ncollecting relationships data and they might help revealing groups that otherwise will remain\nhidden to the analyst knowledge. Observation of the business and enterprise context and\nenvironment is also a method that can lead to better group identification. In this case, the analysis\nof external forces acting on the enterprise may provide relevant information on the relationships\nwith potential stakeholders. Another method is the study of historical data on the business and\nindustry evolution. Historical data typically contains systematic analysis of different performance\nmeasures (e.g. business growth, revenues, market share) that can be correlated with the actions of\nthe focal organization but also with particular phenomena occurring in the environment of that\nfirm that can expose potential stakeholder groups.\n\n- 75 -\n\nThe Litmus Test\nThe next step in the identification process is to apply our stakeholder broad definition presented\nin Chapter 3:\nA stakeholder is any group or individual who directly or indirectly affects or\nis affected by the level of achievement of an enterprise's value creation\nprocesses.\nAlthough this is a broad definition of what constitutes a stakeholder it helps testing whether the\ngroups identified in the previous step may affect or be affected by the enterprise system actions\nwhile it is pursuing the creation of the system level value. Submitting each potential group or\nsubgroup to this litmus test will allow the analyst subjectively considering the potentiality of each\nof those groups to act as a relevant stakeholder. At this stage of the process no ruling out of any\npotential group should occur. The intention of the process is to obtain a comprehensive list of all\nthe groups that can potentially act as stakeholders of the enterprise system. Thus, even if the\nrelationship with a particular group appears to be weak we still want to be able to detect it and\neventually filter that group out in a subsequent stage of the process. If the group under\nconsideration passes this litmus test it will be a qualitative indication that a relationship with the\nfocal organization exists. Consequently, the group under analysis constitutes a potential\nstakeholder of the enterprise system.\nRegistration Process\nIf the litmus test results positive we have identified a potential stakeholder and consequently it\nshould be registered as such together with the analysis of the type and characteristics of the\nrelationship between that group and the focal organization. This will constitute the basis data for\nbuilding the stakeholders' social network in the following phases of the analysis methodology we\nwill develop later in this thesis.\nIn a relationship between two stakeholders there is always some resource that is transferred from\none stakeholder to the other, and vice versa. As we described in Chapter 4, there are many\n\n- 76 -\n\ndifferent types of relational ties that may exist between any two actors in a social network.\n\npresents some examples of the type and characteristics of possible relationships among\nstakeholders.\n\nTable 4\nTable 4: Relationships among stakeholders - Type and Characteristics\nRelationship\nType\nRelationship\nCharacteristics\nExamples\nMaterial\nResources\nVolume, Quantity, Frequency\nSupplies, Raw Materials, Parts,\nComponents, End Products\nFinancial\nResources\nAmount per unit of time\nFunding, Loans, Credits, Stock\nofferings, Payments\nSupport\nResources\nQuality of service\nComputing Services, Telephony\nServices, Cleaning Service\nInformation\nResources\nFrequency, relevance, quality\nDesign blueprints, Requirements,\nSpecifications, Social\nCommunications\n\nProcess Iterations\nStakeholder identification is far from being a one shot process, on the contrary, it is and needs to\nbe an iterative process in which more and more potential stakeholders are identified in each\nround. The first round involves the identification of all the groups that can constitute stakeholders\nof the initially selected focal organization. This phase is iterative, as it needs to proceed group by\ngroup until no further entities are detected. This is represented by the process flow lines going\nback to the beginning of the process in Figure 7.\nAfter this first round of stakeholder identification the next step in this snowball like process is to\nconsider each stakeholder's stakeholders. The same methodology used in the first identification\nround is applied to that end. At this stage the process asks for the selection of an already\nidentified stakeholder as the new focal organization with which to continue the identification of\npotential groups. The process then repeats itself iteratively applying the litmus test and registering\nnewly identified potential stakeholders. This sort of stepwise refinement in the stakeholder\nidentification process allows for a thorough review of the relationships among the different actors\nin the enterprise social network.\n\n- 77 -\n\nWhile considering the relationships of the new focal organization particular attention must be\ngiven to the possible recurrent appearance of the already identified stakeholders. This is an\nopportunity to discover cross-links or interdependencies among different sets of stakeholders\nother than the typical hub-and-spokes network configuration.\nThe identification process continues until every identified stakeholder has been selected as the\nfocal organization with which to conduct the analysis. As we have mentioned before, the\nidentification process must not be conditioned by any filtering mechanism, i.e. all potential\nstakeholders should be included as relevant to the system level value pursued by the enterprise.\nLater in the stakeholder analysis process stakeholders that are not relevant to the enterprise's\nvalue creation process will be filtered out, and those that are most salient will be prioritized.\nStakeholder Salience Methodology\nOnce we have exhaustively identified all potential stakeholders related to a particular value\ncreation process of the enterprise under analysis we need to prioritize those stakeholders\naccording to their relevance or salience. The greater the stakeholder salience the more powerful\nposition it will embody, allowing this stakeholder to modify the behavior of the integrated\nenterprise according to its or some other entity will. However, not only the salience of each\nstakeholder is important to discover influence mechanisms and behavior in stakeholder networks.\nAs we have mentioned before in this thesis the quality and characteristics of the relationships\namong stakeholders are determinants of the ability of any salient stakeholder to exert influence on\nthe rest of the components of the integrated enterprise. In fact, no matter how powerful a certain\nstakeholder can be as defined by its attributes, if it does not have the means of influencing others\nthen its position in the stakeholder network will be rather unfruitful. Those influence\nmechanisms are precisely provided by the relationships - their attributes, quality, and dynamics -\nthat each stakeholder maintains with others in the enterprise system.\nIn this section we develop a methodology for the quantification of stakeholder salience that later\nin the chapter will be used to assess the relevance of the relationships between pairs of\nstakeholders.\n\n- 78 -\n\nThe Stakeholder Salience Index\nIn Chapter 3, where we presented some stakeholder theory concepts, we described a way of\nanalyzing stakeholder salience proposed by Mitchell et al. (1997). We will build on that model\nadding a methodology that allows for effectively measuring stakeholder salience.\nAlthough Mitchell et al. adequately consider the possession of the attributes of power, legitimacy,\nand urgency (that we have replaced for criticality) as determinant of stakeholder salience; they fail\nto show in their propositions elements of a complete methodology to actually measure\nstakeholder salience. Moreover, they assume that the sole presence of a certain number of\nattributes is sufficient to define the salience of a particular stakeholder. Depending on how many\nof those attributes each stakeholder shows so does its importance increase. Thus, for example,\nstakeholders showing all three attributes are more relevant that stakeholders showing only one.\nWhile they recognize that the salience attributes should be regarded as continuous rather than\ndichotomous variables, i.e. the attribute is either present or absent, they do not use that\ncharacteristic to evaluate stakeholder salience.\nWhile the presence of many of the attributes indeed determines salience, we argue that it is the\nlevel of each attribute what actually defines stakeholder salience. If stakeholders have been\nidentified as such, then at least some degree of each of the three attributes will be present. The\nintensity of each attribute will ultimately define the importance of the stakes at risk and\nconsequently the relevance, salience, or importance of the stakeholder. Consequently, we propose\nmeasuring stakeholder salience by a combination of the relative values assigned to each one of the\nattributes of power, legitimacy, and criticality.\nIf we represent the three variables - power, legitimacy, and criticality in a radar-plot chart we will\nobtain a representation similar to the one depicted in\n. Intensity values has been assigned\nto each one of the attributes, in this case a number greater than zero and lower than ten, which\nhas been used as ordinate values for the corresponding attribute axis in the chart. Logically, the\ngreater an attribute value the more importance that attribute has in defining stakeholder salience.\nFor instance, a power value of ten would indicate that the stakeholder has maximum power to\nFigure 8\n\n- 79 -\n\nmake his claims to prosper, whereas a power value of 1 would signify a low ability to influence on\nthe stakeholder system by means of power methods.\nPower\nLegitimacy\nCriticality\n\nFigure 8: Radar plot of stakeholder attributes: Power, Legitimacy, and\nCriticality\nIt is fairly evident by observing the radar plot of Figure 8 that the area of the triangle resultant\nfrom joining the vertices defined by the values of the attributes of power, legitimacy, and\ncriticality is representative of stakeholder salience. A greater area would indicate that the attributes'\nvalues are larger, which means that the stakeholder has more control to claim its stakes at risk\nthan any other stakeholder with less of any or all of the attributes. Consistently with this\ndescription we propose the calculation of a Stakeholder Salience Index (SSI) that is representative\nof the relative importance of the stakeholder in the enterprise network. The SSI is simply equal to\n\n- 80 -\n\nthe area of the triangle defined by the level of each of three attributes. This area can be calculated\nas follows:21\n(\n)\ny\nCriticalit\nLegitimacy\ny\nCriticalit\nPower\nLegitimacy\nPower\nSSI\n×\n+\n×\n+\n×\n= 4\n\n(Eq. 1)\nIf we choose to define the possible range of the stakeholder's attributes as belonging to the\ninterval [0,10] then a value of zero for all three attributes will be representative of a non-\nstakeholder and a value of 10 for all of the three attributes will be representative of a stakeholder\nwith maximum salience. Correspondingly, the minimum value that SSI can take will be 0 for non-\nstakeholders, whereas the maximum value will be 130, or more precisely\n/\n×\n\n(\n)\n(\n/\n×\n+\n×\n+\n×\n×\n).\nA normalized version that accounts for this maximum stakeholder salience value can then be\ncalculated as:\n(\n)\ny\nCriticalit\nLegitimacy\ny\nCriticalit\nPower\nLegitimacy\nPower\nNSSI\n×\n+\n×\n+\n×\n= 3\n\n(Eq. 2)\nUsing this latter equation, the minimum value will still be zero, but the maximum value of the\nsalience index will now be 100, which is more convenient for comparing different stakeholder\nsaliencies.\nMeasuring Power, Legitimacy, and Criticality\nIn order to apply our proposed Stakeholder Salience Index metric we need to somehow assign\nvalues to the each one of the attributes of power, legitimacy, and criticality. The values assigned to\neach one of those variables for a particular stakeholder must be relative to those assigned to any\nother stakeholder in the enterprise. This is to say that a scaling system must be devised in order to\n\n21 The area of the triangle can be calculated as the sum of the areas of the three sub-triangles defined by each pair of attribute axes.\nSub-triangles areas in turn can be calculated as half the value of one of the attributes defining the sub-triangle times the value of\nthe other attribute times sin(60) or, equivalently,\n/\n. Factoring common terms produces the equation presented.\n\n- 81 -\n\naccount for different interpretations of the attribute values for dissimilar stakeholders. Ultimately,\nthe levels for each one of the attributes will be social constructions of the reality, i.e. they are not\nobjective, as Mitchell et al. (1997: 868) adequately state.\nAccordingly, we propose a qualitative assessment questionnaire to define the value for each one\nof the attributes of power, legitimacy, and criticality. This assessment questionnaire is based on\nthe attributes definitions by Mitchell et al. and is presented in Table 5,\n, and\n; each\ntable corresponding to each one of the three attributes. The assessment questionnaire maps\ndifferent attribute factors into numeric values. We have developed guideline propositions for the\nevaluation of each factor each one corresponding to different value ranges. For each factor a\nnumeric level is assigned depending on its strength or intensity as it is evaluated by the analyst.\nUltimately, each attribute level is obtained by averaging the numeric values assigned to each one\nof the factors that defines the attribute. It is also possible to apply weighted averages for the\ncalculation of each attribute depending on the relative importance that each one of the factors has\nfor each particular enterprise environment. For example, in highly cooperative enterprise settings\nit will be difficult to find stakeholders that are willing to use coercive type of power in order to\nobtain value from the system. In this case the coercive power factor of the power attribute might\nbe averaged with a much lower weight than the utilitarian or symbolic types of power. This\nweighted average will prevent the dilution of the attribute value when some low level\ncharacteristics are averaged together with high level ones.\nTable 6\nTable 7\nIt is important to note that in the descriptions we propose for each level we have replaced the\nrather firm-centric definitions provided by Mitchell et al. with more integrative or holistic\ndefinitions. These definitions take into account the fact that the focus of the analysis is the\nintegrated enterprise, not just a particular firm or organization within the system. Whenever\nMitchell et al. mention the firm as the provider or receptor of the stakeholder demands or\ncontributions we have replaced that with similar concepts but operating at the level of the whole\nenterprise system. This makes for a more systemic evaluation of the power, legitimacy, and\ncriticality attributes instead of their particular evaluation in relation to a unique focal firm. The\nreader should be warned that some of the definitions had to be recast in order to account for this\n\n- 82 -\n\ndifferent perspective, and to adapt the definitions to the lean enterprise context in which this\nthesis work is framed.\nIn addition, and particularly for the legitimacy attribute, we have condensed the guideline\nproposition descriptions corresponding to its different factors due to their extension in number\nand types. The different subtypes for this attributes are interpretations from the work of Suchman\n(1995) as cited in Mitchell et al. We leave to the reader the appropriate definitions for the value\nlevels of the factors corresponding to this attribute. Also, we have provided a short version\ndefinition of legitimacy (also from Suchman, 1995) which can be used as a more subjective but\nquite direct way of evaluating the intensity level of this attribute.\nTable 5: Stakeholder's Criticality level determination\nCriticality\nFactor\nLevel Description\nLevel\nrange\nUrgency\nThe stakeholder is time insensible or has very low demands for a

Salience Methodology\nWhile the stakeholder salience index defines the relative importance each identified stakeholder\nhas in relation to the value creation processes of the enterprise, we need to provide a mechanism\nto measure the level of interaction and interdependency among stakeholders. Assessing the\nimportance of the relationships among stakeholders will allow determining which are the most\nrelevant links (and their associated stakeholders) affecting the behavior of the enterprise.\nThe Relationship Salience Index\nOne way of describing the relationship between any pair of stakeholders is by the intensity of\ntheir interaction. We want to be able to describe the value contained in every relationship present\nin the enterprise. We assert that the intensity of the interactions and the value associated with\nthem is related with the salience of each one of the stakeholders participating in each particular\nrelationship. When we introduced our definition of what constitutes a stakeholder we stated that\nthat the expression \"...affects or is affected by...\" was indicative of the relationship among\nstakeholders. In any relationship each party always has the opportunity to affect the other, and at\nthe same time be affected by the actions of that other party. Depending on the relative\nimportance each stakeholder has for the value creation processes of the enterprise its influence\nabilities on other stakeholders in the system (the level with which it can affect others) will increase\naccordingly. Consequently, the intensity with which a stakeholder can affect another in a\nrelationship is directly related with the salience of that stakeholder. Similarly, the salience of the\nstakeholder at the other end the relationship will affect the former.\nIf we assume that the value exchanged in any relationship is in equilibrium as we have stated in\nChapter 4, then the strength of a relationship will be a direct function of the saliencies of each of\nthe stakeholders involved in it. If we were to plot the level by which a stakeholder affects one\nanother in a relationship against the level by which that stakeholder is affected by that other we\nwill obtain a 2x2 matrix of the type represented in Figure 9.\n\n- 86 -\n\nDOMINANT\nRELATIONSHIP\nPOWERFUL\nRELATIONSHIP\nWEAK\nRELATIONSHIP\nSUBORDINATE\nRELATIONSHIP\nStakeholder Relationship Intensity\nExtent to which the stakeholder\nAFFECTS the other actor\nExtent to which the stakeholder\nIS AFFECTED by the other actor\nLOW\nHIGH\nHIGH\nLOW\n\nFigure 9: Stakeholder relationship intensity\nAs we can see in this figure, if the level by which a particular stakeholder affects, and the level by\nwhich it is affected by another stakeholder are both high, then their relationship is defined as\npowerful. In this case these two stakeholders together, through their relationship, can exert a great\ninfluence on the whole enterprise system. Consequently, this type of relationship is highly salient\nand determinant of the enterprise's value creation process results. Powerful in this context does\nnot necessarily mean 'sparkling' in the sense that frictional competition is the only way in which to\nhighly salient stakeholders can interrelate. They can also find cooperative or collaborative ways of\ninteracting to obtain maximum value from their participation in the enterprise. Certainly they will\nhave to precisely coordinate their activities if they want to positively influence the enterprise\nsystem. For example, when two mega-corporations merge their operations to access a new market\n\n- 87 -\n\nor pursue a long-term strategic goal instead of trying to gain benefits on behalf of one another\nthey would rather work together to obtain even further gains.\nIn the other extreme of the relationship intensity matrix, if both stakeholders lowly affect each\nother then the relationship intensity is catalogued as weak. In this case the salience of the\nrelationship and its consequent influence abilities on the enterprise system will be also low.\nIf one of the stakeholders has an influence ability level very different from that of the other\nstakeholder, then the relationship intensity can be either dominant or subordinate depending on\nwhich extreme of the relationship we are analyzing. In any case, a wide difference in the influence\nlevels constitutes a dangerous factor for the stability of the relationship and eventually the whole\nenterprise system. In these cases the dominant stakeholder will eventually try to obtain further\ngains taking advantage of the subordinate stakeholder. An essential role of the managers of\nenterprise systems like this is avoiding those types of situations to occur; or if they are inevitably\npresent, implement the actions and strategies to avoid unfair takeovers.\nIn order to count with a method to measure the level of influence of relationships we propose the\nuse of the Stakeholder Salience Index (or its corresponding normalized version) to measure the\nextent to which one stakeholder affects any other in a relationship. Although that index was\nobtained from the analysis of the influence of each stakeholder on the whole enterprise we reason\nthat the above descriptions are still valid. Two relevant stakeholders interacting while they\nperform some of the enterprise value creation processes define an intense relationship; one that\nwill be highly influential in the enterprise system.\nBased on the above explanations we define the stakeholders' Relationship Salience Index (RSI) as\nthe product of the salience index of each of the stakeholders participating in a relationship. Using\nthe normalized versions of the stakeholder salience index (Eq. 2) and applying a normalization\nfactor to produce an index ranging from 0 to 100, we obtain the following equation:\nB\nA\nNSSI\nNSSI\nNRSI\n×\n=\n\n(Eq. 3)\n\n- 88 -\n\nwhere NRSI is the Normalized Relationship Salience Index, and NSSIA and NSSIB correspond to\nthe normalized stakeholder salience index for stakeholder A and stakeholder B respectively.\nNote that, similarly to the case for the Stakeholder Salience Index, this Relationship Salience\nIndex is proportional to the area of the rectangle formed by the values of the salience indices as\ndepicted in Figure 9. The bigger the area defined by those two values the bigger the impact the\nrelationship will have on the enterprise's value creation processes.\nStakeholder System Structure\nStakeholders and the set of relationships among them define the structure of the enterprise\nsystem. We are interested in assessing the characteristics of the enterprise system structure in\norder to obtain indications about the overall and detailed behavior of the system. Stakeholders'\nstructural measurements provide information on which are the most important organizations or\nclusters of organizations in an enterprise's stakeholder network. Structural analysis allows\ndetermining the relative location of each stakeholder with respect to others in the stakeholder\nnetwork. Consequently, the analysis of the relationships salience levels together with the\ninterpretation of the stakeholder system structure will be essential to assess the efficiency of the\nenterprise's value creation processes.\nWe are also interested in measuring an enterprise's stakeholder network complexity. Every\ncomplex system has an associated form and function, and so does a stakeholders network system.\nThe concepts of form and function and their interrelationship are essential to define the system\narchitecture.22 A system's form talks about the existence of structural complexity (morphological\ncomplexity) whereas a system's function(s) talks about the existence of functional complexity\n(physiological complexity). In a stakeholder system structural complexity informs about the\npotentiality of the system to achieve maximal efficiencies from all entities associated with the\nintegrated enterprise. Structural complexity is an indicator of the maximum level of cooperation\nand efficiency that can be expected from the system. Structural complexity can be measured with\n\n22 Introductory lecture of MIT's graduate level course ESD.34J \"System Architecture\"\n\n- 89 -\n\nstandard social network analysis tools such as network density, and centrality (degree, closeness,\nand betweenness centrality).\nFunctional complexity on the other hand, represents the actual level of interactions among the\nmembers of the stakeholder system. Functional complexity is representative of the actual\nefficiency level attained by the whole system.\nSocial Network Analysis\nIn order to assess the structure of a stakeholder system we will use standard metrics used in social\nnetwork analysis (see Wasserman and Faust, 1994). In particular for the case of stakeholder\nnetworks, we propose the use of the following metrics: stakeholder relationship degree,\nstakeholder network density, and stakeholder centrality measures.\nStakeholder Relationship Degree\nThe first and simplest way of measuring stakeholder's network structure is through the calculation\nof the number of relationships each stakeholder maintains in the enterprise system network. The\nstakeholder relationship degree is directly calculated as the number of links that connects it with\nother stakeholders in the enterprise. The stakeholder relationship degree or nodal degree will be\ndenoted as\nwhere\nidentifies the i\n)\n( is\nd\nis\nth-stakeholder in the system.\nA corresponding System Relationship Degree can be calculated by averaging the relationship\ndegree of all the stakeholders in the enterprise system. It is calculated and denoted as:\nN\ns\nd\nd\nN\ni\n∑\n=\n)\n(\n\n(Eq. 4)\nWhere N is the total number of stakeholders in the system.\nThe variability of the stakeholder relationship degrees can be calculated as the variance of the\ndegrees as follows:\n\n- 90 -\n\n(\n)\n)\n(\nN\nd\ns\nd\nS\nN\ni\nD\n∑\n-\n=\n\n(Eq. 5)\nThe system relationship degree and its corresponding variance can also be calculated for any\nparticular subgroup of interest within the stakeholder system.\nStakeholder Network Density\nStakeholder Network Density measures the actual number of ties or relationships between\nstakeholders with respect to the total possible number of links. The total possible number of links\nis determined by the number of pairwise combinations of all stakeholders in the system, which\ncan be calculated as:\n. This corresponds to the maximum number of\nrelationships that can exist in any stakeholder system comprised of N stakeholders. Then,\nStakeholder Network Density can be calculated as follows:\n/)1\n(\n-\n=\n\nN\nN\nN\n)1\n(\n-\n=\nN\nN\nR\nSND\n\n(Eq. 6)\nWhere R corresponds to the number of relationships actually present in the network. The density\nof the stakeholder network can range from 0, in the hypothetical case of no relationships among\nthe stakeholders (R = 0), to 1, when all possible relationships are present (R = N(N-1)/2).\nIn theory, a highly dense stakeholder network (density close or equal to 1) is a desired state\nbecause as the number of links between stakeholders increase, so does the possibility of achieving\nbetter information flows and resource transactions across the network. However, density also\ntalks about the system functional complexity. In very dense networks consisting of large number\nof stakeholders managing the relationships among those stakeholders can represent a daunting\ntask. Like in every complex system there is a point where more connections imply increasing\n\n- 91 -\n\nlevels of rigidity in the system. This dichotomy can be qualitatively described as depicted in\n.\nFigure\nFigure 10: Stakeholder network density and its related functional Complexity\nStakeholder Network\nFunctional Complexity\nOptimum Network\nDensities\nMinimum\nFunctional\nComplexities\nNetwork\nDensity\nIncreasing N\n\nThe hypothesis we sustain is that as the network density increases (an indication of increasing\nstructural complexity), functional complexity, which is related with the ability of the stakeholder\nnetwork to create value, first decreases until it reaches a minimum, and then starts to increase\nagain until density reaches its maximum. As the number of stakeholders in the network (N)\nincreases, the densities for which functional complexities are minimal decrease. Also, the\nfunctional complexity corresponding to those minimal network densities increases as the number\nof stakeholders in the network grows.\n\n- 92 -\n\nFor relatively large networks it will be more difficult to make the enterprise system function\nproperly, i.e. efficiently, when the number of links among stakeholders is small when compared\nwith the maximum possible. This would mean, for example, that communication channels, supply\nchains, or distribution networks are not sufficiently developed to support the enterprise\noperations. In the other extreme, when every stakeholder is connected with nearly every other in\nthe network, coordinating and managing all the relationships among stakeholders becomes an\nextremely difficult and usually inefficient (not lean) task. These are the situations where, for\ninstance, decentralized management practices and outsourcing alternatives should be considered\nin order to make the enterprise operate more efficiently. When relationships density is very high it\nis rather impossible for a unique central organization to orchestrate the operations of the entire\nenterprise network. There has to be, for each particular enterprise and its corresponding\nstakeholder system, an optimum pattern of relationships for which the functionality of the\nenterprise system is maximum, which is the same as saying that functional complexity is the least\npossible.\nThere is another possible misinterpretation related with stakeholder network's densities.\nCalculating the density for the whole stakeholder network can probably lead to wrong conclusions\nabout the functional efficiency of the enterprise. Because relationships are based on value\nexchanges between stakeholders, and because those value exchanges may very well differ for\ndifferent pairs of stakeholders, it is not necessarily true that more dense networks provide better\noverall system level value. In terms of value creation a stakeholder network may be a highly\nefficient one with very low overall network densities. Instead, it is probably better to consider\n'local densities' calculated over subgroups of stakeholders that perform certain well-defined high-\nlevel functions for the enterprise system, i.e. subgroups that provide certain well-defined type of\nvalue to the network. These subgroup densities will inform about how connected and functionally\nefficient each subgroup is. However, our previously stated hypothesis about highly dense\nnetworks and how that is related to functional efficiency is still valid for subgroups densities. High\ndensity within a subgroup does not necessarily imply better efficiencies in the operations carried\n\n- 93 -\n\nout by that subgroup. There has to be a certain optimum subgroup relationship's density for\nwhich the efficiency is maximal, or equivalently, for which functional complexity is minimal.\nStakeholder Centralities\nStakeholder centrality measurements allow determining which stakeholders are \"more important\"\nin terms of the structural relationships they maintain with the rest of the network. They allow\ndefining the location of each stakeholder in terms of their structural prominence in the\nstakeholder network. Stakeholder centralities also measure how many relationships each\nstakeholder manages and how this allows it to control the relationships among other stakeholders.\nWhen a stakeholder controls a great number of relationships his relevance or importance for the\nenterprise function is potentially larger. On the other hand, when a stakeholder is isolated or in\nthe periphery of the network his power position and the ability to influence the enterprise will be\nvery small.\nHowever, it is important to note that these measures only consider the structural aspects of\nrelationships among stakeholders. If we were to measure the real influential ability of a highly\ncentral stakeholder we will need to consider the type and intensity of the relationships that that\nstakeholder manages. The power position of a stakeholder that manages a great number of\nsecondary relationships is very different from that of another stakeholder that controls fewer\nnumber but very relevant relationships. This is another indication of the dichotomy existent\nbetween a stakeholder network's structural and functional complexities.\nThere exist many ways to measure a stakeholder's centrality. Among them we find degree,\ncloseness, and betweenness centrality. Each one of these metrics provides different and\ncomplementary ways of measuring stakeholder's structural prominence in the stakeholder\nnetwork.\nDegree Centrality. This centrality measure takes into account the number of relationships a\nparticular stakeholder maintains with the rest of the stakeholder network. It is numerically\n\n- 94 -\n\nequivalent to the stakeholder relationship degree that we have previously defined. We write the\ndegree centrality as follows:\n)\n(\n)\n(\ni\ni\nD\ns\nd\ns\nC\n=\n\n(Eq. 7)\nIn order to make this metric independent of the number of stakeholders in the network and be\nable to compare degree centralities between stakeholder networks of different composition we\ncan normalize this measurement as follows:\n)\n(\n)\n(\n'\n-\n= N\ns\nd\ns\nC\ni\ni\nD\n\n(Eq. 8)\nWhere N-1 corresponds to the maximum number of relationships any particular stakeholder can\nestablish, which is equivalent to the number of stakeholders in the system minus the one for\nwhich we are calculating the degree centrality. This normalization allows comparing stakeholder\nnetworks of different size because centralities range from 0 to 1.\nA stakeholder showing very high degree centrality is one that maintains relationships with almost\nevery if not all of the rest of stakeholders in the enterprise system, hence its structural prominence\nis also high as the stakeholder is seen by others as a 'hub' of the system. On the contrary, a\nstakeholder with low degree centrality is one that is seen by the rest of the enterprise as peripheral\nor less relevant. Again, this description is valid only under the assumption that all the relationships\nin the system are all of similar functional importance.\nCloseness Centrality. This metric measures how structurally 'close' a stakeholder is to the rest of\nthe stakeholders in the system. How close is defined by the minimum number of links or\nrelationships that separates the stakeholder from any other stakeholder in the enterprise system.\nHence, a stakeholder would be more central if it does not need to use 'intermediary' stakeholders\nto reach any other stakeholder in the network. For example, if a highly closeness-central\nstakeholder needs to communicate something to the system it can do that directly using its own\nset of relationships with the rest of stakeholders in the network. In contrast, if one stakeholder\n\n- 95 -\n\nneeds to reach one another by using one or more stakeholders in the system then that stakeholder\nis less prominent because it depends on others to properly operate within the system. The firm in\nthe hub or\nhas a high closeness centrality (and also high degree centrality) as it does not\ndepend on any other stakeholder in the network to communicate or relate with every other entity\nin the enterprise. In this case the 'distance' between the firm and any other stakeholder is just one\nlink.\nFigure 3\nThis metric can be calculated as follows:\n∑\n=\n-\n=\nN\nj\nj\ni\ni\nC\ns\ns\nd\nN\ns\nC\n)\n,\n(\n)\n(\n, for all\n\n(Eq. 9)\ni\nj =\nWhere\nrepresents the 'distance' between stakeholder i and stakeholder j. This distance is\ncalculated as the minimum number of links that separate both stakeholders, or equivalently, as the\nminimum number of intermediary stakeholders plus one. The inverse of the summation of all\ndistances to other stakeholders multiplied by a normalization factor (N-1) gives a measure of\ncloseness centrality. The values for closeness centrality can range from 0, for the case of an\nisolated stakeholder who is at 'infinite distance' from the rest of the stakeholders, to 1, for the case\nof a hub-like stakeholder who is at distance 1 from any other stakeholder in the enterprise system.\nIn general, a large closeness centrality is indicative of their independence to access other\nstakeholders in the network (Rowley, 1997: 899)\n)\n,\n(\nj\ni s\ns\nd\nBetweenness Centrality. This metric is similar to the previous one but in this case we measure\nhow many times a particular stakeholder acts as a necessary intermediary in the relationship of any\nother two stakeholders in the network. Using this metric a highly central stakeholder would be\none that is intermediary (hence the term betweenness) and somehow responsible for many of the\nrelationships between other stakeholders in the network. Intermediating in a relationship is a way\nof controlling the actions of part or the entire stakeholder network. This metric can be calculated\nas follows:\n\n- 96 -\n\n/)\n)(\n(\n/)\n(\n)\n(\n-\n-\n=\n∑\n<\nN\nN\ng\ns\ng\ns\nC\nk\nj\njk\ni\njk\ni\nB\n\n(Eq. 10)\nWhere\ncorresponds to the total number of minimal paths (geodesics)\njk\ng\n23 connecting\nstakeholders j and k, and\ncorresponds to the number of those minimal paths in which\nstakeholder i is involved. The denominator term is a normalization factor that corresponds to the\ntotal number of pairs of stakeholders not including i. Figure 11 presents a simple illustrative\nexample to help understanding the calculation of this centrality measure.\n)\n( i\njk s\ng\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\ngAE = 1, gAE(B) = 1\ngAD = 2, gAD(B) = 1\ngED = 1, gED(B) = 1\ngEC = 2, gEC(B) = 2\ngBC = 2, gBC(B) = 0\n\nFigure 11: Betweenness Centrality calculation example\nWe want to calculate the betweenness centrality of stakeholder B. This stakeholder is intermediary\nof the relationship between stakeholders A-D, A-E, E-D, and E-C. Stakeholder B is on the\ngeodesic paths connecting all these stakeholders as the numbers in the figure demonstrates. There\nexist other geodesic between A-D (the path A-C-D) in which B does not participates. Hence,\naccording to equation 10 above, the betweenness centrality of stakeholder B is:\n.0\n/)\n)(\n(\n/\n/\n/\n/\n)\n(\n=\n-\n-\n+\n+\n+\n=\nB\nCB\n\n23 A geodesic is defined as the shortest path between two stakeholders in the network. A path is a sequence of distinct nodes and\ndistinct links connecting nodes.\n\n- 97 -\n\nComparatively, the betweenness centralities for all other stakeholders are: CB(E) = 0, CB(A) =\nCB(D) = 0.167, and CB(C) = 0.08. Hence, according to this metric stakeholder B is the most\ncentral stakeholder of this network, which is also evident in the figure.\nAs a complement of the case of a stakeholder with high closeness centrality, a stakeholder\nshowing high betweenness centrality is one that acts as a broker or gatekeeper of the relationships\nbetween less central stakeholders (Rowley, 1997: 899). A highly central stakeholder using this\nmetric is one that lies along the shortest paths between many pairs of stakeholders as we have\ndemonstrated in the example above.\nGroup Centralities\nFor each one of the structural centralities defined above there exist a corresponding metric that\nmeasures the variability of the centrality values for all the stakeholders in the network. These\ngroup-level metrics inform about how central each stakeholder is with respect to others in the\nnetwork. Comparing the centrality of each stakeholder with this group-level metric will indicate\nthe stakeholder's relative centrality position. Also, this group centrality metrics allow comparing\ndifferent stakeholder networks or even stakeholder subgroups within the same enterprise system.\nEssentially, group centralities are calculated by dividing the summation of the differences of the\nmaximum centrality less each stakeholder's centrality by the maximum theoretically possible set of\ndifferences (which always occur for the star topology). In mathematical notation this would be:\n[\n]\n[\n]\n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n-\n-\n=\nN\ni\ni\nN\ni\ni\ns\nCx\ns\nCx\ns\nCx\ns\nCx\nCx\n)\n(\n*)\n(\nmax\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n\nWhere the Cx notation represents any one of the centrality metrics described above, and Cx\n\nis the corresponding maximum centrality present in the network. The denominator is the\ntheoretical maximum sum of differences in centralities, which is obtained from the consideration\nof all possible network structures containing N stakeholders (Wasserman & Faust, 1994: 176)\n*)\n(s\n\n- 98 -\n\nHence, for each one of the stakeholder centrality types defined above, the corresponding group\ncentralities are defined as follows (Wasserman & Faust, 1994: 180-192):\nGroup Degree Centralization,\n[\n]\n[\n])\n)(\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n-\n-\n-\n= ∑\n=\nN\nN\ns\nC\ns\nC\nC\nN\ni\ni\nD\nD\nD\n\n(Eq. 11)\nGroup Closeness Centralization,\n[\n]\n[\n])\n/(\n)\n)(\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n-\n-\n-\n-\n=\n∑\n=\nN\nN\nN\ns\nC\ns\nC\nN\ni\ni\nC\nC\nC\nC\n\n(Eq. 12)\nGroup Betweenness Centralization,\n[\n]\n)1\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n-\n-\n= ∑\n=\nN\ns\nC\ns\nC\nN\ni\ni\nB\nB\nB\nC\n\n(Eq. 13)\nEach one of these stakeholder system-level centrality metrics can range from 0 to 1, or if\nexpressed in percentages, from 0 to 100%. These network centralization indices will equal 0 when\nall stakeholders are connected with everybody else in the network (all having the same individual\ncentrality index), and equal 1 when one stakeholder completely dominates the network. This latter\ncase corresponds to the star topology where one stakeholder concentrates all the relationships and\nthe others are exclusively connected to that central stakeholder.\nDependency Structure Matrix Methodology\nAnother way of describing the structure of a stakeholder network is through the use of a\nDependency Structure Matrix (DSM). DSM and its associated methodology have been\nsuccessfully applied to the study of engineering system's architectures, product development,\nproject management, and internal organizational studies.24 In these scenarios the DSM\nmethodology is applied to represent patterns of information flow across components, activities,\nor people. In the social network literature a DSM resembles what is known as a sociomatrix. It\n\n24 For applications in these areas of study see Eppinger S.D., Whitney D.E, Simth R.P., and Gebala D.A. (1994); Eppinger S.D.\n(2001); and Eppinger S.D., and Salminen V. (2001).\n\n- 99 -\n\nbasically consists of a matrix where, for the case of our analysis, the rows and columns are\nrepresentative of the identified stakeholders of the enterprise. Hence, a stakeholders DSM will\nalways consist of N x N elements.\nshows an example of a stakeholder network and its\nassociated DSM representation.\nFigure 12\nFigure 12: Stakeholder DSM Example - DSM setup\nFigure 12\nF\nD\nH\nG\nB\nC\nA\nE\nI\nStakeholder\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nThe elements of the DSM are filled with blanks or ones depending on whether a particular\nstakeholder in a row maintains a relationship with one or many of the stakeholders listed in the\ncolumns. In other words, if stakeholder i maintains a relationship with stakeholder k then xij = 1.\nFor example, in\nstakeholder A is linked to stakeholders C and E hence a 1 appears in\nthe corresponding row/columns of the DSM (xAC=1, and xAE=1). The diagonal of a stakeholder\nDSM is filled with blanks as stakeholders cannot relate with themselves. Because we assume that\nrelationships between stakeholders are bidirectional and balanced, i.e. value flows in both\ndirections and is in equilibrium, the stakeholder DSM will be symmetrical. Then, the\ncorresponding elements xji will also equal 1. It is also possible to assign different values, other\nthan 0 or 1, to each element of the DSM in order to represent a particular characteristic of the\nrelationships between stakeholders. For example, the importance, relevance, or intensity of the\nrelationships can be used, which would allow us to study influence patterns across the network.\n\n- 100 -\n\nDetails about the DSM methodology can be found in Eppinger et al. (1994) and Steward D.V.\n(1981). Basically the methodology provides heuristic algorithms that allow partitioning and\nclustering a DSM in such a way that relevant groups of elements within a network become\nevident. By applying these heuristics to a stakeholder DSM we will be able to identify some of the\nstructural and functional characteristics of the stakeholder network. For instance, detecting\nstructural clusters inside the network is easily performed once a DSM is partitioned, i.e. once its\nrows and columns are permuted in order to group closely related stakeholders. Further analysis of\na stakeholder DSM may reveal key stakeholders or key relationships. For example, by closely\ninspecting a stakeholder DSM we can identify stakeholders that serve as nexus between two\ndifferent subgroups within the enterprise system, or a relationship that is essential for the proper\nbehavior of the enterprise.\nF\nD\nH\nG\nB\nC\nA\nE\nI\nStakeholder\nA\nC\nI\nE\nF\nD\nG\nH\nB\nA\n\nC\n\nI\n\nE\n\nF\n\nD\n\nG\n\nH\n\nB\n\nCluster 2\nCluster 1\nClusters Link\nClusters Link\nCluster 1\nCluster 2\n\nFigure 13: Stakeholder DSM Example - Partitioning and Clustering\nFigure 13\nContinuing with our example, in\nwe have permuted some of the rows and columns in\nthe DSM to reveal the existence of two important clusters within this network (identified as\nCluster 1 and Cluster 2). Those two clusters are represented by the boxes traced on the diagonal\nof the DSM, which comprise the set of relationships maintained by stakeholders within each one\nof the clusters. Moreover, these two clusters are interconnected by just one relationship, the link\nbetween stakeholders E and F, which is also clearly shown in the stakeholder DSM as an element\n\n- 101 -\n\noutside the cluster boxes. This single relationship is crucial for the operation of this network; if\nsomehow it gets compromised the enterprise will literally be divided up in two, hindering\ncommunications or information flows between those two stakeholder clusters.\nIn short, a stakeholder DSM provides relevant information on the structure of a stakeholder\nnetwork. Functional evaluations of the clusters and connections between them will depend on the\ncharacteristics of the enterprise under analysis. We will cover this aspect of a stakeholder DSM in\nour application example presented in the next chapter.\nMeasuring Functional Complexity\nAll the metrics and methods described above to assess stakeholders' networks have the problem\nof being exclusively based on the existence of dichotomous relationships among stakeholders; the\nrelationships are either present or absent. This way all possible network measurements obtained\nwill only be indicative of the network structural complexity, i.e. how stakeholders are\ninterconnected. The hope is that those evaluations of structural complexity somehow will provide\ninformation about the way the stakeholder network functions. This goal is partially attained as the\nproposed metrics give an indication of the network potentiality to use its structural characteristics\nand connectiveness to provide the required network functionality. In our case this functionality is\nrepresented by local value exchanges among stakeholders and ultimately the delivery of the system\nlevel value for which the stakeholder network was created or evolved. The analysis above calls for\na methodology to measure the functional characteristics of stakeholders' networks.\nCloseness and betweenness centrality measures depend on the determination of the shortest paths\n(geodesics) linking pairs of stakeholders. Moreover, both indices exclusively rely on the number of\ngeodesics connecting a pair of stakeholders excluding any other possible, although longer, path\nbetween them. This is an important drawback of these metrics as communications, information\nflow, or any other type of exchanges within the network can also make use of longer but\nfunctionally more efficient paths. Ultimately, value flow across the network will follow the paths\nof least resistance, which are not necessarily the structural shortest paths.\n\n- 102 -\n\nStephenson and Zelen (1989) developed a method for measuring actor centralities in social\nnetworks that takes into account not only the geodesics but all the paths connecting any two\nactors in the network. Furthermore, the method can also be applied to valued relationships where\neach of the links between actors can take numeric values other than the mere zero or one\nindicating the absence or presence of a relationship. Their proposed centrality metric will reflect\nthe relative weights of those valued relationships when measuring the relevance of each actor in\nthe network.\nDue to the consideration of those two important characteristics - path completeness and\nweighted or valued relationships - we propose this metric to assess the functional complexity of a\nstakeholder network. Furthermore, we propose the use of our Relationship Salience Index as the\nnumeric value to consider when weighting the relationships among stakeholders. This index\nmeasures the intensity of the relationship between any two stakeholders and consequently we will\nbe measuring how relationship's strengths mold the functional characteristics of the stakeholder\nnetwork. The idea is that when this index is large, indicating a strong relationship between two\nstakeholders, the stakes that are into play in the relationship acquire more relevance for the rest of\nthe network hence positively influencing value flow across that link. In other words, the relevance\nof the stakes present in the relationships is an attractor for the value creation processes of the\nentire enterprise. The assumption is that the whole stakeholder network will work (function) to\nfirstly satisfy the most salient stakeholders and their corresponding relationships.\nStephenson and Zelen centrality metric is called \"information centrality\" because it considers\nrelationships as channels through which information can flow across the network. The metric\ngives weights to the relationships according to the \"information\" they contain. They first derive\nthe formulation based on the bare links between actors and then they extend the concepts to\nconsider valued relationships. Basing their work on statistical estimation theory they state that, in\ngeneral, information is the reciprocal of the variance of the observation. Paths in a network are\nenvisioned as signals connecting any two nodes. The noise in the transmission of that signal is\ntypically measured by the variance of the signal when it travels from one node to the other. Paths\nthat are composed of more than one link can be thought as the transmission of as many\n\n- 103 -\n\nindependent signals as links are in the path. Consequently the variance (noise) in the transmission\nwill be the sum of the variances of each of those links (the variance of the sum of two or more\nindependent events equals the sum of the variances of each event). The variance of each link is\ndefined as 1 for non-valued relationships hence the variance of a path will be equal to its length.\nTo account for the fact that there may be several paths connecting any two actors in a network,\nStephenson and Zelen propose the idea of a combined path measure that is the summation of\neach path length connecting the actors, each one affected by a weight factor. This weight factor is\nsimply the proportion of the total information that is transmitted through each corresponding\npath. Total information is the sum of the information carried by each one of the paths. The use of\nthose weight factors maximizes the information transmitted through the combined path.\nCorrections on the weight factors are necessary if different paths use common linking elements\n(relationships).\nFinally, Stephenson and Zelen define the information centrality of an actor as the harmonic\naverage of the information associated with the paths connecting that actor to every other actor in\nthe network. Mathematically,\n∑\n=\n=\nN\nj\nij\nI\nI\nN\ni\nC\n/\n)\n(\n\nWhere CI(i) is the information centrality of actor i, Iij is the information of actor i with actor j,\nand N is the number of actors in the network.\n\n- 104 -\n\nAs Stephenson and Zelen demonstrate in their paper the calculation of the information between\nactors (Iij) can be done by simply inverting a matrix that is easily derived from the adjacency\nmatrix.25 The square matrix B = (bij), containing NxN elements, is defined as follows:\nJ\nA\nr\nD\nB\n+\n-\n=\n)\n(\n, where D(r) is a diagonal matrix of the nodal degrees (same as the ones used\nto calculate degree centralities) corresponding to each stakeholder; A is the adjacency matrix; and J\nis a square matrix with all elements unity.\nThen, by defining the matrix C = (cij )= B-1 (the inverse of the above defined B matrix) we can\ncalculate the values for Iij (the information in the combined path from stakeholder i to\nstakeholder j) as follows:\n)\n(\n-\n-\n+\n=\nij\njj\nii\nij\nc\nc\nc\nI\n\nThe denominator of the equation for information centrality is developed as follows:\n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n-\n+\n=\n-\n+\n=\nN\nj\nN\nj\nii\nij\njj\nii\nij\nR\nT\nNc\nc\nc\nc\nI\n)\n(\n/\n\nwhere T\nis the sum of the elements in the diagonal of C, and\n∑\n=\n=\nN\nj\njj\nc\n∑\n=\n=\nN\nj\nijc\nR\nis the sum of the elements of any of the rows of C (R is the same for any of the rows)\nThe information centrality for a stakeholder i will be:\n\n25 Equivalently to a stakeholder DSM, the elements of the adjacency matrix contains the information of which actor is related with\nwhich other(s) in the network. The rows and the columns of the matrix represent the actors and a numeric value 1 in a particular\nelement indicates that the actors in the corresponding row and column maintain a relationship.\n\n- 105 -\n\nN\nR\nT\nc\nR\nT\nNc\nN\ni\nC\nii\nii\nI\n/)\n(\n)\n(\n-\n+\n=\n-\n+\n=\n\n(Eq. 14)\nThis metric can be easily extended to the case when values are assigned to the links between\nstakeholders. In our case, as it was proposed above, the relationships will be assigned the values\ndictated by the Relationship Salience Index. The matrix B for the case of valued relationships is\ncalculated as follows:\nJ\nW\nS\nB\n+\n-\n=\n\nWhere J is a square matrix with all elements unity as before, W is the Relationship Salience Indices\nmatrix (similar to the adjacency matrix A but instead of ones indicating a relationship the value of\nthe relationship salience index occupies that element), and S is a diagonal matrix of the sum of the\nweights (the sum of each row of W). Using this valued B matrix the procedure to calculate\nstakeholder's information centralities is identical as the case for non-valued relationships.\n\nThe methods and tools developed in this chapter will help analyzing the structural and functional\ncharacteristics of stakeholder networks. Ultimately, this analysis will allow assessing the efficiency\nor leanness of an enterprise's value creation processes in terms of the existence of wasteful\nstructural and functional patterns within the network.\n\n- 106 -\n\nC H A P T E R 7\nAPPLICATION EXAMPLE\nThis chapter presents the application of the concepts and methods developed in previous\nchapters to a real case scenario. The example we have chosen to develop corresponds to the\nstakeholders' system in which the firm Payload Systems Incorporated, a small aerospace\nengineering company located in Cambridge, MA, participates.\nCompany Background26\nBecause Payload Systems will be the focus of our analysis we will provide a short description of\nthe company background that will help understanding the environment in which it develops its\nactivities.\nPayload Systems has approximately 30 full-time, part-time, and consultant employees, all located\nin their Cambridge facilities. 90% of the employees are technical (engineers, technicians, and\nscientists). About half of these have advanced degrees. The company has approximately 2.5 M$\nin revenue per year. It was founded in 1984 to provide engineering in support of spaceflight\nresearch, with a particular focus on manned spaceflight. Since that time, the company has\ndeveloped a reputation for providing top-quality, high-value science, technology, and design\nservices to a wide range of customers, both commercial and governmental, including several\ninternational clients. The company can claim that in 18 years of flying dozens of spaceflight\nexperiments and other hardware, not a single experiment has had an unrecoverable failure once\non orbit. In spite of its small size, Payload Systems can claim several \"firsts\": First US company\nto place a commercial payload onboard Mir space station; First US Payload Specialist; First\ncomplex payload on-board the International Space Station.\n\n26 The content of this section title is an adaptation from the introductory section of N. Clark, J. de Luis, I. Grossi, and T. Seitz,\n'Lean Transformation of a NASA Flight Hardware Development Enterprise: Payload Systems Inc., Cell Culture Unit', presented as a class\nproject final paper for MIT's graduate course ESD.61J Integrating The Lean Enterprise, Fall 2002\n\n- 107 -\n\nTraditionally, the typical Payload Systems client was a researcher in a university that had already\nperformed ground studies and experiments on an innovative technology or scientific theory that\nnow required experimentation in space. Payload Systems would work with the researcher and\nhelp him or her obtain funding for the space-component of their experiment. Typically, this\nfunding would come from one of the national space or defense agencies, e.g., NASA, USAF,\nNASDA (Japan), ESA (Europe), etc. Working closely with the researchers, Payload Systems\nwould design and fabricate the experiment or hardware so that it met all the unique requirements\nof the spaceflight environment, as well as meeting the scientific objectives. Payload would also be\nresponsible for astronaut training, launch support, mission control operations, and data and\nhardware recovery.\nMore recently, Payload Systems has expanded their expertise to become first-tier contractors to\nNASA, and first-tier subcontractors to Boeing, the company responsible for the fabrication of the\nInternational Space Station. This has led Payload to significantly upgrade their processes and\ncapabilities to deal with the additional requirements that these new roles demand, particularly in\nthe fields of safety, verification, and quality assurance.\nMore specifically, the company divides its expertise and services into the following three\ncategories:\nExperiment Support, which includes,\n-\nFlight systems design\n-\nFlight systems test protocol development\n-\nFlight systems certification\n-\nPayload integration\n-\nCrew training\n-\nGround processing\n-\nMission support\n\n- 108 -\n\nFlight Systems Development. This focuses on the design and fabrication of the hardware and\nsoftware itself. The company has developed flight systems that have addressed a wide spectrum\nof technical and scientific areas, including, fluid and structural, life sciences and biochemistry,\nHuman performance, communication systems, as well as generic electronic and mechanical design\nof spacecraft components.\nGround Test Support. Payload Systems has also taken part in extensive ground research, and\nassisted dozens of investigators in preparation for and performance of parabolic flight proof-\ntesting and data collection on the NASA/JSC KC-135, providing many of these clients with the\npreliminary results necessary to commence preparation for spaceflight.\nTechnology innovation and special projects. Over the years, Payload Systems has provided\ntechnical guidance and/or conducted numerous ground and preflight research or research &\ndevelopment projects in support of our clients' science and technology needs. These projects have\nranged from a few weeks to a few years in duration, and have spanned fields from plant growth to\ntelerobotics. Payload Systems' staff take pride in combining technical excellence and flexibility in\napproaching all of its projects, whether small or large, fundamental or applied, spacebound or\nearthbound.\nPayload Systems' major competitors are other small aerospace firms, or firms with small\naerospace enterprises, such as SHOT Technologies, Hernandez Engineering, and Veridian Inc.\nHowever, because of declining space budgets, Payload Systems often finds itself competing\nagainst much larger firms, such as Lockheed Martin and TRW. One competitive advantage, in\naddition to its lower costs and flexibility, is the fact that the company is a certified Small\nDisadvantaged Business, which allows prime contractors to meet their SDB subcontracting goals\nwhile obtaining value for their end products.\n\n- 109 -\n\nFocus of the Stakeholder Analysis\nThe focus of analysis in this application example will be related with Payload Systems' most\nimportant project: the Cell Culture Unit engineering system and its associated stakeholder system.\nThis project accounts nowadays for the majority of the revenues and efforts of the company;\nhence the example will be rich in the importance and actuality of the enterprise stakeholders.\nThe Cell Culture Unit (CCU) system is the first of several habitats that will provide unprecedented\naccess and capabilities for long duration life science experiments onboard the International Space\nStation (ISS). It will be capable of providing a controlled environment for the study of many\ndifferent types of specimens, including animal, microbial or plant cells, aquatic specimens, and\ntissue aggregates. The unit can be operated manually, through ground control, or automatically.\nIt will be delivered to the ISS, and returned to earth by the space shuttle. Specimens may be\nexamined remotely during the mission via a video microscopy subsystem, by crew members using\nthe Life Sciences Glovebox, or post-mission on Earth. The facility will allow scientists previously\nimpossible opportunities to determine the role of gravity in the life cycle of living organisms, and\nunderstand how cellular organisms and cultures adapt to microgravity over multiple generations.\nThe CCU contract was awarded in October 1996 to Payload Systems and its partners: MIT's\nTissue Engineering Laboratory and Mide Technology Corporation. Payload Systems acts as the\nprime contractor for this project. At present, CCU has successfully completed its Preliminary\nDesign Review and is entering the critical design phase. Phase 0 and Phase 1 Safety Reviews have\nbeen successfully completed at the Johnson Space Center. Prototypical science evaluation\nhardware is currently being tested at Payload Systems laboratories, and will soon be shipped to\nscientists at NASA Ames Research Center and universities around the country to perform further\nexperimentations. The first flight of the CCU system onboard the ISS is presently scheduled for\nyear 2006.\nCCU is one of the programs of the Space Station Biological Research Project (SSBRP) located at\nNASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in Mountain View, CA, who is responsible for the facilities\nthat will be used to conduct life sciences research on board the ISS. Some of the features of these\n\n- 110 -\n\nfacilities include multiple habitats to support a variety of organisms, a centrifuge with a selectable\nrotation rate to house specimens at a variety of gravity levels, a holding rack to house specimens\nat microgravity, and a fully equipped workstation/Glovebox. Also provided will be microscopes,\nfreezers, and other laboratory research equipment to conduct experimental procedures.\nThe SSBRP in turn, is part of the Astrobiology and Space Research Directorate (Code S) at Ames\nResearch Center whose mission is to conduct research, develop products, and serve the space\ncommunity in astrobiology and related areas of earth, space, and life science. The work of the\nDirectorate supports, and is funded by all of the NASA Enterprises. This Directorate at NASA\nARC is part of the Office of Biological and Physical Research (Code U) enterprise at NASA\nHeadquarters.\nNASA ARC working with international partners has played a significant role in the design and\ndevelopment of the ISS since the early 1980s. ARC's development of the first space-based,\ncontinuously available, life sciences research facility, the Space Station Fundamental Biology\nResearch Facility (SSFBRF) (see\n) was recognized as a major science benefit to all\nparticipating ISS investigators. Top-level science requirements have been developed by an on-\ngoing Science Working Group (SWG) and include the capability to provide \"artificial gravity\", life\nsupport and monitoring for animal, plant, and insect, aquatic cell research subjects and specimens\non a large (2.5-m diameter), variable-speed centrifuge.\nFigure 14\nThe Space Station Biological Research Project (SSBRP) is an integrated project team, which\nincludes ARC staff matrixed from various organizations, with the mission to design and develop\nthe systems required to support a wide range of fundamental gravitational biology research on the\nISS. The SSBRP also performs all system integration functions for hardware, software phases and\nflight. SSBRP is responsible for managing the development of several habitats (CCU being one of\nthem) with international collaboration that provide life support, environmental control, and\nmonitoring systems for various research subjects and specimens. The habitats are being\ndeveloped to operate with three major host systems: the variable-gravity, 2.5-m centrifuge; the\n\n- 111 -\n\nmicrogravity holding racks; and the Life Sciences Glovebox. In addition, SSBRP will manage the\ndevelopment of various Lab equipment items needed for science operations in the SSFBRF.\nSource: SSBRP web site\nCell Culture Unit\nhabitat\n\nFigure 14: Space Station Fundamental Biology Research Facility (SSFBRF)\nThe habitats, host systems, and lab equipment items are being fabricated by a mix of several\noutside contractors (among them, Payload Systems Inc.) and other space agencies. Testing will be\ndone at various developmental stages by both the hardware developers and SSBRP staff\nconsisting of engineering, science, and operations specialists.\n\n- 112 -\n\nCCU Stakeholder Analysis\nThe sections that follow will cover the application of the methodologies to identify, prioritize, and\nstructurally and functional assess stakeholder's networks we have described in previous chapters\nof this thesis to the particular case of the CCU enterprise.\nCCU Stakeholders Identification\nThe first step in the stakeholder identification process is to define the system level value. For the\ncase of the CCU enterprise we will define the system level value in the form of a \"To... By\"\ngrammatical construction as follows:\nTo conceptualize, design, implement, deliver, and operate a high quality Cell Culture Unit payload By\ncomplying with NASA's safety requirements and performing the science functions for it was conceived.\nThis will be the guiding intent for the CCU enterprise system that will allow for the identification\nof potential stakeholders and stakeholder groups.\nThe next step is to choose the initial focal organization. We will start with Payload Systems as the\ninitial organization to consider for the identification of stakeholders. Although we recognize that\nthis selection may result in a rather firm-centric view of the CCU enterprise system it will allow\nfor a simpler determination of the enterprise's boundaries.\nThe methodology used to identify groups that could constitute potential stakeholders was by\nconducting several interviews with Payload Systems' CEO, Dr. Javier de Luis. In those interviews\nthe CCU enterprise was analyzed in depth to allow the appearance of tacit or hidden groups that\nmay act as potential stakeholders. Another method we used extensively was the analysis of factual\nevidence from NASA's myriad of organizations. This was carried out delving into the agency's\nand other relevant Internet web sites. Whenever possible we have omitted the real names of the\ncompanies, organizations, and individuals participating as stakeholders in the CCU project in\norder to protect their real and ongoing stakes at risk in the enterprise.\n\n- 113 -\n\nAs it is foreseeable Payload Systems maintains relationships with several stakeholders that\ncontribute to the value creation processes related with the CCU project. Traditional stakeholders\nsuch as suppliers and customers/end-users acquire particular relevance for this enterprise as\nrelationships with them present noteworthy characteristics. In the case of suppliers it is the\ngeneral rule for space engineering companies that their corresponding supply chains are actually\nquite short. This is the case because of the one-of-a-kind or very short production series typical of\nthis industry, which does not allow suppliers to attain appropriate economies of scale to let them\ndecentralize or outsource their operations. Therefore, the number of suppliers is small and they\nare typically organized in a single layer below the contracting organization. In other words, only\nfirst-tier suppliers exist in space engineering payloads development.27\nThe description above is not different for the CCU project. Only one Science Evaluation Unit\nand one Flight Unit are being produced and the majority of the fabrication and integration is\nbeing done in-house. Suppliers for the CCU enterprise reduce to a few companies that basically\nprovide raw materials, semi-elaborated components, or very critical parts for the fabrication of the\nCCU prototypes and flight unit. For clarity purposes we have classified and grouped those\nsuppliers as pertaining to three different stakeholder groups, named Suppliers A, B, and C. Type\nA Suppliers are those whose products or services are essential for the development of the project.\nThese stakeholders are very difficult if not impossible to replace; they are, for example, unique\nsuppliers of critical CCU's components such as very specific peristaltic pumps, digital cameras,\nand microscopes used in certain subsystems of the payload. Type B Suppliers include those\nsuppliers that, although important or critical for the development of the CCU payload, can be\nsubstituted with little effort for other similar suppliers. This is the case, for example, of suppliers\nof design-specific electronic parts or specific materials for structural components of the CCU\npayload. Type C suppliers are those providing commodity-type components or supplies such as\noffice products, nuts and bolts, or packaging materials. All of these supplier types are in direct\n\n27 These concepts are further developed in de Luis J., 'A Lean Safety Review Process for Payloads on the International Space Station', Thesis\nM S (in preparation) - Massachusetts Institute of Technology, System Design and Management program\n\n- 114 -\n\nrelationship with Payload Systems. We haven't found in our stakeholder's identification process\nsecond tier suppliers that were relevant for the CCU enterprise.\nIn a slightly different supplier's category we find some important subcontractors. This is the case\nof the company that performs all the mechanized parts that later on Payload Systems will be\nintegrating in the prototypes or flight hardware. The relationship with this supplier is a highly\ncooperative one and although the subcontractor is an independent company there exists a sort of\nsymbiotic relationship between the two firms. They mutually depend on each other for their\noperations. Payload Systems relies almost exclusively on this subcontractor for every mechanism\nit has to implement from the blueprints produced by the company. For the subcontractor this\nrelationship contributes a substantial portion of its revenues. They have learned to work together\nas allied partners in this industry. The interfaces between the two firms are somewhat fuzzy in the\nsense that they show large integration of their activities, almost to the point that the subcontractor\nacts as a Payload's internal working group. In our water-drop model terminology this\nsubcontractor constitutes an allied supplier.\nOn the side of customers and end users we find different NASA organizations participating in the\nCCU enterprise. Although all these organizations and different groups within them belong to a\ncommon entity - NASA - they act, for the purposes of the CCU project, as different\nstakeholders. The core of the relationships is with groups belonging to NASA Ames Research\nCenter. Under the organizational umbrella of ARC's Space Station Biology Research Project there\nexist a number of groups that can potentially affect or be affected by the development actions of\nthe CCU project. Among them we find the groups developing other type of habitats for the\nfacility (there are 6 other habitats under development), the groups developing supporting systems\n(like holding racks, glovebox system, and the centrifuge device), project management office, safety\n& mission assurance office, operation groups, systems engineering groups, and system integration\ngroups. Also, the SSBRP office must coordinate the CCU development efforts with projects of\nother divisions of the Astrobiology and Space Research Directorate to which the CCU project\nultimately belongs. The project also has ties with NASA's agency wide program in fundamental\n\n- 115 -\n\nbiology: the Fundamental Biology Program at NASA headquarters, which have a Science\nWorking Group and a Project Scientist supervising, among others, the CCU development efforts.\nTwo other centers at NASA are deeply involved in the CCU enterprise: the Johnson Space Center\n(JSC) in Houston TX, and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, FL. The JSC is\nhome of the ISS program coordination, Mission Control Center facilities for both the space\nshuttle and the ISS, and Astronauts Training Facility. Subgroups within these three organizations\nhave important stakes in the development of the CCU. First, because the final destination and\noperational environment of the CCU is the SSFBRF on board the ISS all the interfaces and safety\nguidelines of the CCU with the ISS must be worked out with the ISS program at JSC. Second,\nbecause operations of the CCU can be directed from ground, these activities are typically carried\nout by specialty groups at the MCC, hence the necessity of coordination of all the operational\naspects of the CCU payload. Third, because the CCU is transported into orbit, installed, and\noperated by astronauts either of the shuttle or temporary residents of the ISS there exist a set of\noperational training that must be done with different groups of astronauts.\nOn the other hand, the KSC is in charge of the coordination of the launching activities of the\nspace shuttle, which is the carrier of the CCU payload to its final destination: the ISS. Within KSC\nthere exist a Shuttle Safety group and a Payload Integration group, both having strong interests\n(stakes) in the development of the CCU, particularly in what concerns the schedule and safety\nissues related with the CCU mission.\nTable 8 summarizes the results of the first cycle of the stakeholder identification process where all\npotential stakeholders with whom Payload Systems maintains relationships have been listed. A\nbrief rationale for them passing the litmus test of the identification process is included together\nwith the type of relationship each of the potential stakeholders maintains with Payload Systems.\npresents other stakeholders that although not directly connected to Payload Systems are\nessential for the value creation processes related with the CCU project.\nTable 9\n\n- 116 -\n\nTable 8: Payload Systems - CCU project stakeholders\nStakeholder\nRationale\nRelationship type\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\nHabitat Development Group\nResponsible for the development of\nthe seven habitats that will be\ninstalled in the SSFBRF module\nonboard ISS\nBidirectional transfer of project\nand programmatic information.\nHabitat Development - CCU\nThis is the interface office at NASA\nfor all technical issues regarding\nCCU's development\nBidirectional transfer of project\ninformation and evaluation unit\nprototypes\nFlight Unit\nIntegration - CCU\nCoordinates integration and testing\nactivities within the SSFBRF\nTransfer of integration and testing\ninformation and science evaluation\nunit prototypes\nCCU Project Control\nProvides and requires programmatic\ninformation regarding CCU\nTransfer of programmatic\ninformation\nSystems Safety & Mission\nAssurance\nProvides safety requirements,\nrequires its enforcement, and\nparticipates in CCU's safety reviews\nTransfer of safety information\nOperations\nProvides and receives CCU\noperations information\nTransfer of operations information\nSSBRP office\nProvides organizational umbrella for\nthe CCU project\nTransfer of programmatic\ninformation\nNASA Johnson Space Center\n\nMission Control Center\nProvides operational capabilities to\nthe CCU mission\nTransfer of CCU's operational\ninformation and support\nISS Payloads office\nProvides ISS safety and interface\nrequirements to the CCU mission.\nCommission CCU payload for\nnominal operations\nTransfer of ISS related safety and\ninterface information\nShuttle Astronauts\nThey are responsible for the\ntransportation and installation of the\nCCU\nTransfer of safety, setup, and\ninstallation information\nISS Astronauts\nThey are responsible for onboard\noperations of the CCU payload\nTransfer of safety, and operational\ninformation\nNASA Kennedy Space Center\n\nShuttle Safety Group\nThey establish and enforce safety\nrequirements for the transportation\nof CCU to the ISS onboard the space\nshuttle\nTransfer of safety information:\nrequirements and compliance\ndocuments\nShuttle Payload Integration\nGroup\nCoordinate the integration activities\nof the CCU payload to the space\nshuttle\nTransfer of CCU payload flight\nunit, and safety related information\nCCU Principal Investigators\nAre responsible for the definition of\nthe scientific requirements of the\nCCU mission and its scientific results\nTransfer of science requirements\nand trade-offs information.\nTransfer of science data\nPSI employees\nProvides engineering capabilities and\nlogistics support to the CCU project\nTransfer of work hours and wages.\nAffiliation to PSI\n\n- 117 -\n\nStakeholder\nRationale\nRelationship type\nPSI owners\nProvides company financial support\nand strategic guidance\nOwnership formal role, receives\ndividends from company revenues\nSubcontractors\n\nMechanisms Subcontractor\nProvides mechanical workshop\ncapabilities to Payload Systems.\nTransfer of raw materials,\nelaborated parts, and financial\nresources\nMide Technologies Co.\nProvides mechanical subsystems\ndesign, fabrication and testing\ncapabilities to the CCU project\nTransfer of requirements, designs,\ncomponents, and financial\nresources\nOther Subcontractors\nProvide services related with the\nCCU project\nTransfer of services and financial\nresources\nClass A Suppliers\nThese suppliers provide critical\ncomponents and are hard or\nimpossible to replace.

This methodology is based on the\nquantification of the power, legitimacy, and criticality attributes of each one of the stakeholders\nwhen evaluated from a system level perspective.\nFor the power attribute we have only averaged the utilitarian and symbolic types of power since it\nis hard to find in this industry stakeholder groups willing to exert coercive (force, violence, or\nrestraint) form of power. For the legitimacy attribute, and for the sake of clarity in the\npresentation of the data, we have condensed and averaged the legitimacy subtypes characteristics\ninto one of the three types - pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy.\nThe result of the quantification of the salience of each stakeholder using the Stakeholder Salience\nIndex shows interesting results. Among the most relevant stakeholders, those that most affect the\nsystem level value we have defined for the CCU enterprise, we find that Payload Systems is the\nmost salient stakeholder (NSSI = 100). This comes as no surprise since it is precisely this\norganization that is the one that concentrates the majority of the efforts in the development of the\nCCU payload. Also high in the rank of salience we find the CCU Habitat Development liaison\noffice at NASA ARC. This stakeholder is the most notorious interface of the project with the\ncustomer (NASA), Payload Systems' Employees and Owners, and the SSBRP office at NASA\nARC which is the overall technical customer of the CCU project. Other important stakeholders\ninclude the Habitat Development Head at NASA ARC and the US Congress. This latter\nstakeholder is the one that ultimately provides the necessary financial resources in the form of\napproval of annual budgets for ISS research programs development.\n\n- 120 -\n\n- 121 -\nTable 10: CCU Stakeholder Salience Indices calculations\nStakeholder\nID\nCoercive\nUtilitarian\nSymbolic\nPower\nAverage\nPragmatic\nMoral\nCognitive\nLegitimacy\nAverage\nUrgency\nImportance\nCriticality\nAverage\nSSI\n(Eq. 1)\nNSSI\n(Eq. 2)\nRank\nPayload Systems Inc.\nS01\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n129.9\n100.0\nNASA Ames Research Center\nHabitat Development Groups Head\nS02\n8.0\n10.0\n9.0\n104.8\n80.7\nHabitat Development - CCU\nS03\n9.5\n10.0\n10.0\n125.6\n96.7\nOther Habitats Development Groups\nS04\n3.0\n7.3\n3.0\n22.9\n17.7\nHost Systems - Glovebox\nS05\n3.5\n5.3\n4.5\n25.3\n19.5\nHost Systems - Holding Rack\nS06\n3.5\n5.7\n5.0\n28.4\n21.9\nLaboratory Support Equipment\nS07\n2.5\n5.7\n4.5\n22.0\n17.0\nFlight Unit Integration - CCU\nS08\n7.0\n7.0\n7.0\n63.7\n49.0\nCCU Project Control\nS09\n9.5\n7.3\n9.0\n95.8\n73.7\nSystems Safety & Mission Assurance\nS10\n9.5\n7.0\n8.0\n86.0\n66.2\nOperations\nS11\n6.0\n6.7\n7.0\n55.7\n42.9\nSSBRP office\nS12\n9.5\n8.0\n9.5\n104.9\n80.8\nNASA Headquarters\nFBP - Science Working Group\nS13\n4.5\n5.0\n6.5\n36.5\n28.1\nFBP - Project Scientist\nS14\n4.5\n5.7\n6.5\n39.7\n30.5\nProgrammatic Office\nS15\n8.5\n7.3\n8.0\n81.8\n63.0\nNASA Johnson Space Center\nMission Control Center\nS16\n5.0\n8.0\n7.5\n59.5\n45.8\nISS Payloads office\nS17\n4.5\n8.0\n7.5\n56.2\n43.3\nShuttle Astronauts\nS18\n5.5\n8.7\n6.5\n60.5\n46.6\nISS Astronauts\nS19\n5.5\n8.7\n7.0\n63.6\n48.9\nNASA Kennedy Space Center\nShuttle Safety Group\nS20\n5.5\n3.7\n6.0\n32.5\n25.1\nShuttle Payload Integration Group\nS21\n5.5\n3.3\n5.5\n29.0\n22.3\nCCU Principal Investigators\nS22\n7.0\n9.0\n9.5\n93.1\n71.7\nPSI employees\nS23\n9.0\n9.3\n9.5\n111.8\n86.1\nPSI owners\nS24\n8.5\n10.0\n9.0\n108.9\n83.8\nClass A Suppliers\nS25\n8.0\n8.7\n5.5\n69.7\n53.7\nClass B Suppliers\nS26\n6.0\n6.3\n5.5\n45.8\n35.3\nClass C Suppliers\nS27\n3.0\n5.3\n4.0\n21.4\n16.4\nUS Congress\nS28\n8.0\n9.3\n8.0\n92.4\n71.1\nUS Federal Government\nS29\n6.0\n8.0\n7.5\n66.3\n51.0\nUS Taxpayers/Society\nS30\n6.5\n4.3\n3.5\n28.6\n22.0\nMedia\nS31\n5.0\n2.0\n4.0\n16.5\n12.7\nInternational Research Community\nS32\n6.5\n4.3\n5.0\n35.7\n27.4\nMIT Tissue Engineering Lab\nS33\n4.0\n7.3\n5.0\n37.2\n28.7\nSubcontractors\nMechanisms Subcontractor\nS34\n6.5\n7.3\n6.0\n56.6\n43.6\nMide Technologies\nS35\n5.0\n6.3\n6.0\n43.2\n33.2\nOther Subcontractors\nS36\n3.0\n5.3\n5.0\n25.0\n19.2\nPower Attribute\nLegitimacy Attribute\nCriticality Attribute\nSalience Index\n\nOn the other side of the scale we find the least relevant stakeholders - those showing low\nStakeholder Salience Index. Among them we can mention the news Media that, although\ninterested in the overall objectives of the CCU project, remain waiting expectant for the final\nresults of the mission. Also, Class C Suppliers and Other Subcontractors show low relevancies in\nCCU's value creation efforts, which is logical since their goods are not critical for the project or\ntheir supplies can be easily replaced by goods coming from alternate suppliers or subcontractors.\nIn between those extremes we find stakeholders with medium saliencies that, although important\nfor CCU's development efforts, are not as critical, powerful, or legitimate as other more relevant\nstakeholders. Among those we find, for example, the Astronauts of both the Space Shuttle and\nthe ISS. They are fundamental for the transportation and operation of the CCU payload on orbit,\nand they should be trained accordingly, but being those tasks part of the regular activities of any\nastronaut they should be capable of doing those operational activities as part of their normal\nresponsibilities. In this sense the CCU payload is just another piece of equipment they have to\noperate. Therefore, the astronaut's relevance for the CCU project is not that important, at least\nfor the current state of the project.\nCCU Stakeholders Relationship Saliencies\nTable 11 presents the stakeholder relationships information in the form of an adjacency matrix -\nequivalent to a sociomatrix, or a DSM construction - where the rows and columns both represent\neach one of the stakeholders related with the CCU enterprise. A number one in a particular row\nand column element indicates that the stakeholder in that row maintains a relationship with the\nstakeholder in the corresponding column. These relationships are established because two\nstakeholders have some particular interest in the value creation processes of the CCU project. A\nblank cell in the matrix is indicative of no relationship, or, in the case of the diagonal elements of\nthe matrix, that each stakeholder cannot relate to itself. If the relationships are bidirectional - like\nit is the case for all the CCU enterprise stakeholders - the adjacency matrix will end up being\nsymmetrical.\n- 122 -\n\n- 123 -\nTable 11: CCU Stakeholder Relationships - Adjacency Matrix\nStakeholder\nID\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nS05\nS06\nS07\nS08\nS09\nS10\nS11\nS12\nS13\nS14\nS15\nS16\nS17\nS18\nS19\nS20\nS21\nS22\nS23\nS24\nS25\nS26\nS27\nS28\nS29\nS30\nS31\nS32\nS33\nS34\nS35\nS36\nPayload Systems Inc.\nS01\n1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1\nNASA Ames Research Center\nHabitat Development Groups Head\nS02\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nHabitat Development - CCU\nS03\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1\nOther Habitats Development Groups\nS04\n1 1\nHost Systems - Glovebox\nS05\n1 1\nHost Systems - Holding Rack\nS06\n1 1\n1 1 1\nLaboratory Support Equipment\nS07\n1 1\nFlight Unit Integration - CCU\nS08\n1 1\n1 1\nCCU Project Control\nS09\n1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1\nSystems Safety & Mission Assurance\nS10\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1\nOperations\nS11\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nSSBRP office\nS12\n1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nNASA Headquarters\nFBP - Science Working Group\nS13\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nFBP - Project Scientist\nS14\n1 1\n1 1\nProgrammatic Office\nS15\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nNASA Johnson Space Center\nMission Control Center\nS16\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nISS Payloads office\nS17\n1 1\n1 1 1\nShuttle Astronauts\nS18\n1 1 1\n1 1\nISS Astronauts\nS19\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nNASA Kennedy Space Center\nShuttle Safety Group\nS20\nShuttle Payload Integration Group\nS21\n1 1 1\nCCU Principal Investigators\nS22\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nPSI employees\nS23\nPSI owners\nS24\nClass A Suppliers\nS25\n1 1\nClass B Suppliers\nS26\nClass C Suppliers\nS27\nUS Congress\nS28\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nUS Federal Government\nS29\n1 1 1\n1 1\nUS Taxpayers/Society\nS30\n1 1\nMedia\nS31\n1 1\n1 1 1\nInternational Research Community\nS32\n1 1\n1 1 1\nMIT Tissue Engineering Lab\nS33\nSubcontractors\nMechanisms Subcontractor\nS34\n1 1 1\nMide Technologies\nS35\nOther Subcontractors\nS36\n\nIt is important to recall here that whenever a relationship exists between any two stakeholders it\nwill be necessarily associated, in this particular example, to the CCU enterprise. In other words,\nalthough any two stakeholders may maintain a relationship for some other reasons other than the\nCCU project, they do not necessarily use that relationship to obtain or provide value from or to\nthe CCU enterprise. For example, although Other Habitat Development Groups stakeholder\nmaintains a relationship with the Host Systems-Glovebox stakeholder, this relationship is not held\nbecause it affects or can be affected by CCU enterprise's value creation processes, but rather\nbecause they need to resolve the problems arising from their particular payloads. In cases like\nthese the elements in the adjacency matrix are left blank indicating that those stakeholders are not\nlinked due to the CCU project. Generalizing this idea, the same concept can be applied to any\nstakeholder network pursuing some system level value.\nThe adjacency matrix only informs about the existence of a relationship between two\nstakeholders, but it does not account for the type, or even less, the intensity of that relationship.\npresents the calculation of the stakeholders' normalized Relationship Salience Index\naccording to Eq. 3 in Chapter 6. In the table the values entered in the diagonal of the matrix\ncorrespond to the Stakeholder Salience Indices calculated before. Then, if there is a value one in a\nparticular element of the adjacency matrix - indicative of a relationship between two stakeholders,\nthe Normalized Relationship Salience Index is calculated simply by multiplying the elements in\nthe diagonal of the matrix corresponding to the row and column of that element.\nTable 12\nSome of the most intense or important relationships are those held by Payload Systems and other\nrelevant stakeholders, like CCU's Habitat Development program office or the Habitat\nDevelopment Groups Head at NASA ARC. The intensity of the relationships between these\nstakeholders is high because they need to communicate frequently to define different\nprogrammatic issues regarding CCU development. Another very important relationship is that\nmaintained by Payload Systems and its employees (NRSI = 86.1). Employees are a key\ndevelopment factor for these types of labor and ingenuity intensive projects, hence the necessity\nto articulate a good and strong relationship.\n- 124 -\n\n- 125 -\n\nTable 12: CCU Stakeholder's Relationship Salience Indices\nStakeholder\nID\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nS05\nS06\nS07\nS08\nS09\nS10\nS11\nS12\nS13\nS14\nS15\nS16\nS17\nS18\nS19\nS20\nS21\nS22\nS23\nS24\nS25\nS26\nS27\nS28\nS29\nS30\nS31\nS32\nS33\nS34\nS35\nS36\nPayload Systems Inc.\nS01\n100.0\n80.7\n96.7\n49.0\n73.7\n66.2\n42.9\n45.8 43.3 46.6 48.9\n25.1\n22.3\n71.7\n86.1\n83.8\n53.7\n35.3\n16.4\n12.7\n28.7\n43.6 33.2 19.2\nNASA Ames Research Center\nHabitat Development Groups Head\nS02\n80.7\n80.7 78.0\n14.3\n15.7\n17.7\n13.7\n39.5\n59.5\n53.4\n34.6\n65.1\n37.0 34.9\n57.8\n10.2\n22.1\nHabitat Development - CCU\nS03\n96.7\n78.0\n96.7 17.1\n18.8\n21.2\n16.4\n47.4\n71.3\n64.0\n41.5\n44.3 41.8 45.0 47.3\n24.2\n21.6\n69.3\n27.7\nOther Habitats Development Groups\nS04\n14.3\n17.1\n17.7\n14.3\nHost Systems - Glovebox\nS05\n15.7\n18.8\n19.5\n14.4\n8.4\n8.9\n9.5\nHost Systems - Holding Rack\nS06\n17.7\n21.2\n21.9\n10.7\n16.1\n14.5\n9.5\n10.7\nLaboratory Support Equipment\nS07\n13.7\n16.4\n17.0\n12.5\n7.3\n7.8\n8.3\nFlight Unit Integration - CCU\nS08\n49.0\n39.5\n47.4\n10.7\n49.0 36.1\n21.2\n12.3\n10.9\nCCU Project Control\nS09\n73.7\n59.5\n71.3\n14.4\n16.1\n12.5\n36.1\n73.7 48.8\n31.6\n59.5\n46.4\n31.9\n16.4\n20.2\nSystems Safety & Mission Assurance\nS10\n66.2\n53.4\n64.0\n14.5\n48.8\n66.2 28.4\n53.4\n20.2\n30.3 28.6 30.8 32.4\n16.6\n14.8\nOperations\nS11\n42.9\n34.6\n41.5\n8.4\n7.3\n31.6\n28.4\n42.9\n19.7\n20.0 21.0\n30.7\n11.8\nSSBRP office\nS12\n65.1\n14.3\n59.5\n53.4\n80.8\n22.7 24.7 50.9\n37.6 39.5\n57.9\n10.2\n22.2\nNASA Headquarters\nFBP - Science Working Group\nS13\n22.7\n28.1\n8.6\n17.7\n20.1\n20.0\n14.3\n3.6\n7.7\nFBP - Project Scientist\nS14\n20.2\n24.7\n8.6\n30.5 19.2\n21.9\n21.7\n15.6\n3.9\n8.4\nProgrammatic Office\nS15\n46.4\n50.9\n17.7 19.2\n63.0\n28.9 27.2\n45.2\n44.8\n32.1\n17.3\nNASA Johnson Space Center\nMission Control Center\nS16\n45.8\n37.0\n44.3\n8.9\n7.8\n30.3\n19.7\n28.9\n45.8\n21.4 22.4\n32.8\n12.6\nISS Payloads office\nS17\n43.3\n34.9\n41.8\n9.5\n21.2\n31.9\n28.6\n27.2\n43.3\nShuttle Astronauts\nS18\n46.6\n45.0\n30.8\n20.0\n37.6\n21.4\n46.6 22.8\n11.7\n10.4\nISS Astronauts\nS19\n48.9\n47.3\n9.5\n10.7\n8.3\n32.4\n21.0\n39.5\n22.4\n22.8\n48.9\n35.1\n6.2\nNASA Kennedy Space Center\nShuttle Safety Group\nS20\n25.1\n24.2\n12.3\n16.6\n11.7\n25.1\n5.6\nShuttle Payload Integration Group\nS21\n22.3\n21.6\n10.9\n16.4\n14.8\n10.4\n5.6\n22.3\nCCU Principal Investigators\nS22\n71.7\n57.8\n69.3\n30.7\n57.9\n20.1 21.9 45.2\n32.8\n35.1\n71.7\n9.1\n19.7\n20.5\nPSI employees\nS23\n86.1\n86.1\nPSI owners\nS24\n83.8\n83.8\nClass A Suppliers\nS25\n53.7\n53.7\n23.4 17.8\nClass B Suppliers\nS26\n35.3\n35.3\n15.4\nClass C Suppliers\nS27\n16.4\n16.4\n7.2\nUS Congress\nS28\n20.0 21.7 44.8\n71.1 36.3\n15.7\n9.0\nUS Federal Government\nS29\n14.3 15.6 32.1\n36.3\n51.0 11.2\n6.5\nUS Taxpayers/Society\nS30\n15.7\n11.2\n22.0\n2.8\nMedia\nS31\n12.7\n10.2\n10.2\n3.6\n3.9\n6.2\n9.1\n9.0\n6.5\n2.8\n12.7\nInternational Research Community\nS32\n22.1\n20.2\n11.8\n22.2\n7.7\n8.4\n17.3\n12.6\n19.7\n27.4\nMIT Tissue Engineering Lab\nS33\n28.7\n27.7\n20.5\n28.7\nSubcontractors\nMechanisms Subcontractor\nS34\n43.6\n23.4\n15.4\n7.2\n43.6\nMide Technologies\nS35\n33.2\n17.8\n33.2\nOther Subcontractors\nS36\n19.2\n19.2\n\nOn the low values of relationship intensities we can mention the relationship indices\ncorresponding to the ties of the news Media and every other stakeholder. The news Media does\nnot hold very strong relationships with any of the stakeholders in the CCU enterprise network.\nThis is understandable since the project, in its current state, is not at risk nor has flown yet,\nmaking it of low importance to the media. In other words, the CCU payload development\nactivities are not breaking news.\nCCU Stakeholders Network Structure\nNetwork Density\nCCU enterprise's stakeholder network density can be calculated using Eq. 6 in Chapter 6. The\nnumber of relationships in CCU's stakeholder network (R) is 143. Because the adjacency matrix is\nsymmetrical, to obtain R we only need to count the total number of elements equal 1 in the\nmatrix and divide that number by two.\nThe total possible number of relationships in CCU's stakeholder network adds up to 630. This\nfigure is calculated knowing that the number of stakeholders N in the network is 36 and applying\nthe combinatory equation N(N-1)/2.\nThen, CCU's stakeholder network density can be calculated as follows:\n.0\n)1\n(\n)1\n(\n=\n-\n×\n×\n=\n-\n=\nN\nN\nR\nSND\n, or equivalently 23%\nAlthough CCU stakeholder network's density is not very high we shall recall that this network\nattribute is only an indicator of structural complexity and that its calculation over the entire\nstakeholder network can lead to wrong conclusions about the ability of the network to function\nproperly or more efficiently. When we analyze the densities for subgroups of stakeholders then\nthis figure starts to acquire some relevance. For example, we can calculate the density of\nrelationships in the subgroup formed by Payload Systems and all the stakeholders related with\nNASA ARC. This subgroup of stakeholders altogether is the one that technically and\n- 126 -\n\nprogrammatically defines the CCU project. In other words, this is the value exchanged by this\nsubgroup with the rest of the enterprise system. For this subgroup the density is calculated again\nusing Eq. 6 but with its variables constrained to the stakeholders in that subgroup. Then, the\ndensity of relationships for this subgroup of 12 stakeholders is:\n.0\n)1\n(\n)1\n(\n=\n-\n×\n×\n=\n-\n=\nS\nS\nS\nS\nN\nN\nR\nSND\n, or 57%\nThis figure is now indicative of a somewhat dense stakeholder sub-network, which can be\ncorroborated by visually inspecting the adjacency matrix for stakeholders S01 to S12. A possible\nexplanation of why this is so the case is that the development of a complex payload like CCU\nrequires great amounts of coordination activities among all the participants of this subgroup,\nhence the necessity of a large number of relationships that allow for easily transferring\ninformation and resources. Moreover, the safety requirements imposed in a payload that will fly\nonboard both the space shuttle and the ISS require active and permanent involvement of many of\nthe constituents of this stakeholder network subgroup, which also increases the need for fluent\nand complex relationships among its members.\nAs we mentioned in our analysis of the density attribute of stakeholder networks in Chapter 6,\nlarger densities do not mean that the network will function better. The set of relationships in this\nCCU development subgroup seem to be adequate for the progress of the project given its\nduration, budget, and the relative size of the stakeholders involved in it. According to Payload\nSystems' CEO the project is not under big pressures, either on budget or schedule, which would\nindicate that this subgroup is functioning adequately with this set of established relationships.\nMore relationships (higher density) in this stakeholder sub-network will make the system to work\nless efficiently as stakeholders will have to devote much more time to maintain the relationships\nwith the rest of the stakeholders in the subgroup.\n\n- 127 -\n\nStakeholders Centralities\nThe calculations of CCU stakeholders' degree centralities and the overall network degree\ncentrality are quite straightforward from the data contained in the adjacency matrix. Their\ncalculation involves the computation of the nodal degrees, i.e. the number of relationships\nentering or leaving a stakeholder node. Those figures can be easily obtained by summing up the\nrow or the column corresponding to that stakeholder in the adjacency matrix. For example, for\nPayload Systems the nodal degree adds up to 23 indicating that this stakeholder maintains\nrelationships with 23 other stakeholders in CCU enterprise's network. This happens to be also the\nmaximum degree centrality of the whole stakeholder network (C\n), which will be used to\ncalculate the overall network degree centrality once the centralities for every stakeholder have\nbeen computed. The normalized version of the degree centrality is obtained dividing each\nstakeholder nodal degree by the maximum number of relationships each stakeholder can hold in\nthe network. For the CCU stakeholder network this number is 35 since there are a total of 36\nstakeholders and each one of them can hold a maximum of (36 - 1) relationships with any other\nstakeholder in the system. Hence for Payload Systems the corresponding normalized degree\ncentrality is 23/35 = 0.66 or 66%, which means that this stakeholder maintains relationships with\n66% of the stakeholders in the CCU enterprise. Consequently, according to this measure Payload\nSystems is a highly central stakeholder one that controls many of the relationships in the network.\n*)\n(s\nD\nFor the calculation of closeness and betweenness centralities it is necessary to calculate the\ngeodesics, or shortest path lengths, connecting any two stakeholders. Geodesics can be calculated\nby analyzing the successive powers of the adjacency matrix (Wasserman & Faust, 1994: 161). If an\nelement in the adjacency matrix has value 1 then a geodesic of length 1 connecting the\ncorresponding row and column stakeholders exist. If the square power of the adjacency matrix\nturns an element from 0 to a value greater than zero then there exist a geodesic of length 2\nconnecting the corresponding stakeholders. In other words, the power for which a particular\nelement in the adjacency matrix turns from 0 to a non-zero value is the length of the geodesic\nconnecting the row and column corresponding to that element.\n\n- 128 -\n\nBut instead of doing this process manually in MS Excel we have relied on UCINET, a software\napplication specifically developed for social network analysis.28 This software calculates the typical\nmetrics used in social network analysis such as densities and centralities (in all of its forms) among\nothers, and allows for different ways of visually presenting the structural position of actors in a\nsocial network. UCINET is able to use the stakeholders' adjacency matrix (\n) as input to\ncalculate the above-mentioned metrics.\npresents the results of the calculations\nperformed with UCINET on the relationship data contained in the adjacency matrix of the CCU\nstakeholder network. Also included in this table are some statistical measures on each of the\ncentrality measures data.\nTable 11\nTable 13\nThe different centrality metric's data confirms that Payload Systems is the most central\nstakeholder of the CCU enterprise system. In fact, because this stakeholder is the one that\nconcentrates all the development efforts of the CCU payload, it has to coordinate activities and\noperations with many other stakeholders in the network - exactly with 66% of the stakeholders\naccording to the degree centrality metric, constituting one of the most important hubs of the\nCCU enterprise. Payload Systems also accounts for the highest closeness centrality, meaning that\nit needs of very few intermediaries to reach every other stakeholder in the network. Its farness to\nevery other stakeholder adds up to 47, which represents the total number of links separating\nPayload Systems from all other stakeholders in the enterprise. This is the lowest farness of the\nCCU network. Betweenness centrality is also maximum for Payload Systems and far greater than\nthe corresponding centrality for every other stakeholder, which is also evidenced by a very high\nstandard deviation of this data set. A large betweenness centrality means again that Payload\nSystems is a hub in the stakeholder system because it lies between the communication or\nrelationship paths of many other stakeholders in the network. All other stakeholders have much\nless ability of being an intermediary in the relationship of other stakeholders.\n\n28 see Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G. and Freeman, L.C. (2002).

This is coherent with their function of providing\nthe voice of the client to the CCU enterprise. They are responsible for coordinating and enforcing\nthe budgetary, programmatic, and mission assurance aspects of the CCU payload, having to\ninteract with many other stakeholders to this achieve this end.\nOn the low side of the centralities measures we find stakeholders like Class C Suppliers and Other\nSubcontractors. Their relevancy for the value creation processes of the CCU enterprise is\ncomparatively very low with respect to those of more central stakeholders. Correspondingly their\ncentralities - degree, closeness, and betweenness are small. By inspecting the adjacency matrix we\nsee that those stakeholders maintain very few relationships with the network and very few\nstakeholders use them as intermediaries to relate with other stakeholders. In a sense, they belong\nto the periphery of the stakeholder network.\nNetwork Centralization Indices\nUsing equations 11, 12, and 13 in Chapter 6 we can calculate the variability of each centrality\nmeasure along the whole stakeholder network. To ease the process we have pre-calculated the\nnumerator for each centrality type in\n. Each of the columns labeled 'Cmax - C' contains\nthe difference between the maximum centrality in the network and the centrality value\ncorresponding to each stakeholder. At the bottom of each column the summation of those\ndifferences over all the stakeholders in the network is performed. Then, the corresponding\nnetwork centralities are calculated as follows (Eq. 11, 12, and 13):\nTable 13\nNetwork Degree Centralization:\n[\n]\n[\n]\n%\n.\n)\n)(\n(\n)\n)(\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n=\n-\n-\n=\n-\n-\n-\n= ∑\n=\nN\nN\ns\nC\ns\nC\nC\nN\ni\ni\nD\nD\nD\n\n- 131 -\n\nRecall that this metric reaches value 100% when there is one and only one stakeholder that\nconcentrates all the relationships with all other stakeholders. This would be the case of the star or\nhub-and-spokes network topology exemplified in Figure 3. Then, this network centralization\nmetric accounts for the degree of presence of a single stakeholder concentrating all the\nrelationships in the network. For the case of the CCU stakeholder network there exists an\nimportant degree of centralization, 45.55%, indicating that only a few stakeholders concentrate\nmost of the relationships in the network. This is effectively the case as it can be visually\ncorroborated by inspecting the adjacency matrix.\nNetwork Closeness Centralization:\n[\n]\n[\n]\n%\n.\n)]\n/(\n)\n)(\n[(\n.\n)\n/(\n)\n)(\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n=\n-\n×\n-\n-\n=\n-\n-\n-\n-\n=\n∑\n=\nN\nN\nN\ns\nC\ns\nC\nC\nN\ni\ni\nC\nC\nC\n\nSimilar to the previous network centralization measure this Network Closeness Centrality reaches\nvalue 100% for a star-like network topology. This would indicate the presence of a hub that is at\ndistance one of every other stakeholder in the network not necessitating of any intermediary\nstakeholder to reach any of those other stakeholders. For the case of the CCU enterprise the\nresult of this metric is representative of a very connected network, one with enough relationships\nto allow for value exchanges along the network using very few intermediary stakeholders. For\nexample, if a Class A Supplier would need to reach the Principal Investigator to resolve a technical\nissue it would need to ask Payload Systems to act as an intermediary of that relationship.\nNetwork Betweenness Centralization:\n[\n]\n%\n7.\n)1\n(\n.\n)1\n(\n)\n(\n*)\n(\n=\n-\n=\n-\n-\n= ∑\n=\nN\ns\nC\ns\nC\nC\nN\ni\ni\nB\nB\nB\n\n- 132 -\n\nAgain this is a measure of the concentration of power (relationships) by a single stakeholder. In\nthis case it measures the brokerage capabilities present in the whole stakeholder network. Like the\nprevious two network centralization metrics this one reaches 100% for the star-like topology. A\ncentral stakeholder in this case is an intermediary of every other stakeholder, hence, its power to\ncontrol the network. For the CCU stakeholder network the value obtained for this measure is\nrepresentative of just a few stakeholders acting as brokers or intermediaries of the exchanges\nbetween less central stakeholders.\nIn any of these measures of network centralization, one needs to be careful about their\ninterpretation. The question of structural versus functional complexity arises again here. The\nexistences of many relationships among stakeholders in the network and of a few central\nstakeholders that can potentially relay value across the network do not guarantee that the network\nwill function more efficiently. Value flows can encounter functional barriers in the network that\nmay hinder the achievement of a lean enterprise, one in which relationship related waste is\nminimal or non existent. It is the way the network uses those relationships which provide the real\nability of the system to be more functionally efficient. Structural connectivity is a necessary\ncondition for stakeholder networks' efficiency but it is not a sufficient one. The functional\ncharacteristics of the network will be the determinant of the efficiency of the system.\n\nStakeholder DSM analysis\nOur next step in the stakeholder analysis process is to perform a DSM type of study about the\nstructure of the CCU enterprise system. Partitioning and clustering the stakeholder's adjacency\nmatrix will inform us about elements of structure of the CCU stakeholder network. Those\noperations will allow for the identification of subgroups or clusters of stakeholders that can be\npotentially relevant for the value creation processes of the CCU enterprise. Moreover, it will be\nimportant to analyze the relationships among those subgroups in order to qualitatively assess the\nnetwork's functional efficiency.\n\n- 133 -\n\nFigure 15 shows the DSM analysis performed on the CCU stakeholder's adjacency matrix (\n) where we have manually partitioned and clustered the matrix using the techniques described\nin Chapter 6. To perform the row and column permutations we have relied on assumptions\nregarding both the structural and functional aspects of the CCU enterprise. We have highlighted\nand labeled the resultant stakeholders' subgroups according to the high-level function they\nperform in the CCU enterprise.\nTable\nThe DSM analysis shows the existence of five relevant stakeholders' subgroups within the CCU\nenterprise. We have identified those subgroups as follows: Payload Development, Mission\nDefinition, Mission Assurance & Operations, Suppliers, and Financial & Societal Support. Each\none of these subgroups performs functions that are essential for the CCU enterprise's value\ncreation processes. The Payload Development subgroup is in charge of the schedule, budget\nadministration, and technical issues of the CCU payload. Internally they coordinate all sorts of\ntechnical development activities as well as all programmatic aspects of the CCU development.\nThe Mission Definition subgroup has the responsibility of defining the science objectives of the\nCCU mission. There are many stakeholders that participate in this process; several groups from\nNASA, different Principal Investigators and MIT's Tissue Engineering Lab. Together they define\nand continuously refine the CCU's mission goals and requirements. The Mission Assurance &\nOperations subgroup is in charge of coordinating all the activities within the CCU enterprise\nnetwork that allows guaranteeing that CCU will provide the required scientific results, and that it\nwill do so in a safe manner for both the space shuttle transporter and the whole ISS system. Note\nthat for this subgroup we have artificially duplicated two of the stakeholders in the DSM -\nSystems Safety & Mission Assurance, and Operations stakeholders, as they actively participate in\nthis subgroup and also in the Payload Development subgroup. We also find the Suppliers\nsubgroup where all the relevant suppliers and subcontractors interact, fundamentally with Payload\nSystems but also among them, to provide components, products, and services that are going to be\nintegrated into the CCU payload.\n\n- 134 -\n\n- 135 -\nStakeholder\nID\nS01\nS02\nS03\nS04\nS05\nS06\nS07\nS08\nS09\nS10\nS11\nS12\nS13\nS14\nS15\nS22\nS32\nS33\nS10b\nS11b\nS16\nS17\nS18\nS19\nS20\nS21\nS25\nS26\nS27\nS34\nPayload Systems Inc.\nS01\n1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nHabitat Development Groups Head\nS02\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1 1\nHabitat Development - CCU\nS03\n1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOther Habitats Development Groups\nS04\n1 1\nHost Systems - Glovebox\nS05\n1 1\n1 1\nHost Systems - Holding Rack\nS06\n1 1\n1 1 1\nLaboratory Support Equipment\nS07\n1 1\n1 1\nFlight Unit Integration - CCU\nS08\n1 1 1\n1 1\nCCU Project Control\nS09\n1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1\nSystems Safety & Mission Assurance\nS10\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOperations\nS11\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nSSBRP office\nS12\n1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1\nFBP - Science Working Group\nS13\n1 1 1 1\nFBP - Project Scientist\nS14\n1 1\n1 1 1\nProgrammatic Office\nS15\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nCCU Principal Investigators\nS22\n1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nInternational Research Community\nS32\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1\nMIT Tissue Engineering Lab\nS33\nSystems Safety & Mission Assurance\nS10b\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOperations\nS11b\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nMission Control Center\nS16\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nISS Payloads office\nS17\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nShuttle Astronauts\nS18\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nISS Astronauts\nS19\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nShuttle Safety Group\nS20\nShuttle Payload Integration Group\nS21\n1 1 1\nClass A Suppliers\nS25\nClass B Suppliers\nS26\nClass C Suppliers\nS27\nPAYLOAD\nDEVELOPMENT\nMISSION DEFINITION\nMISSION ASSURANCE\n& OPERATIONS\nRel\nPay\nand M\n& O\nRela\nMiss\nMissi\nOps\nFigure 15: CCU Stakeholders - DSM Analysis\nS35\nS28\nS29\nS30\nS31\nS23\nS24\nS36\n1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\nMechanisms Subcontractor\nS34\n1 1 1\nMide Technologies\nS35\nUS Congress\nS28\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nUS Federal Government\nS29\n1 1 1\n1 1\nUS Taxpayers/Society\nS30\n1 1\nMedia\nS31\n1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\nPSI employees\nS23\nPSI owners\nS24\nOther Subcontractors\nS36\ntionships between\nion Definition and\non Assurance &\n. subgroups\nationships between\nload Development\nission Assurance\nps. subgroups\nSUPPLIERS\nFINANCIAL &\nSOCIETAL SUPPORT\n\nLastly, but not less important, there is the Financial & Societal Support subgroup which provides\nthe necessary funds to the CCU enterprise through the indirect participation of taxpayers, the\ndirect budgetary approval actions by the US Congress, and the overall mission objectives support\nby the US Federal Government. Also in this group the presence of the Media stakeholder helps in\ncommunicating the benefits of the program to the different stakeholders within it and to other\nstakeholders in the network as well.\nAll these five subgroups do not work in isolation, they need to interact and cooperate with many\nother subgroups in order to make the CCU enterprise progress towards its required value creation\nobjectives. The interactions among subgroups are evidenced in the DSM by the non-zero\nelements of the matrix outside each of the identified subgroups. For example, the Mission\nAssurance & Operations subgroup interacts heavily with the Payload Development and the\nMission Definition subgroups. This is the case because the former subgroup needs input from the\nlatter subgroups in order to guarantee the required mission objectives while guarding the safety of\nall the assets and people on ground and in orbit. On the other hand, the Mission Assurance &\nOperations subgroup provides requirements, tradeoffs, and constraints to both before mentioned\ninteracting subgroups.\nIt is interesting to note that Payload Systems maintain relationships with all of the above\nmentioned stakeholders' subgroups and as such its position in the DSM is at the top of the matrix\nembracing all other stakeholders and subgroups. This confirms that Payload Systems is the most\ncentral stakeholder in the CCU enterprise as our different centrality metric results had previously\nshown.\nSummarizing, a DSM analysis allows obtaining a higher-level view of the CCU stakeholder\nnetwork abstracting from the low level details of the interactions among individual stakeholders.\nThis higher level view allows for the identification of relevant functional groups and the\nimportant interactions among them that in combination defines the value creation processes and\nresults of the CCU enterprise. The complexity of the analysis of the relationships in the CCU\n\n- 136 -\n\nstakeholder network and their structural and functional implications is reduced significantly when\nusing a DSM analysis methodology.\nCCU Stakeholders Network Functionality\nWe turn now to the calculation of the information centrality metric for each of the stakeholders\nof the CCU enterprise. This metric will allow us to a better understanding of the functional\ncharacteristics of CCU's stakeholder network.\nTable 14 shows the B matrix necessary to perform the calculations of the information centralities\naccording to Eq. 14 in Chapter 6. The matrix was easily constructed in MS Excel from the data in\ncorresponding to the stakeholders' Relationship Salience Indices. Also, we used MS\nExcel's MINVERSE standard function to calculate C, the inverse of the B matrix, and from there\nwe calculated the T and R parameters necessary in Eq. 14 as it was explained in Chapter 6.\npresents the Information Centralities calculated for each one of the stakeholders in the CCU\nenterprise network.\nTable 12\nTable\nVery much like the previously calculated centrality measures, Information Centrality ranks the\nmore salient and highly connected stakeholders as the more central ones. This is the case of\nPayload Systems (S01), Habitat Development -CCU (S03), and Habitat Development Group\nHead (S02) among some others. Also, either low salient or less connected stakeholders that\nshould be located in the periphery of the stakeholder network receive coherent low centrality\nvalues. For instance, Class C Suppliers (S27) and Other Subcontractors (S36) are ranked as the\nlowest central stakeholders in accordance with their corresponding degree, closeness, and\nbetweenness centrality measures.

functional characteristics of\nthe CCU's stakeholder network. In particular, this metric allows for the identification of relevant\nstakeholders that are very important for the CCU enterprise. This is the case, for example, of\nPayload Systems' employees (S23) and owners (S24). Because they maintain very few relationships\nwith other stakeholders in the network they are catalogued with very low centralities by any of the\nstructural measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities) as can be seen in\n.\nAccording to these measures those two stakeholders belong to the periphery of the network. For\ninstance, betweenness centralities for both stakeholders (and many others) end up being zero,\nmainly because no other stakeholder depends on them to communicate with the rest of the\nnetwork. But, we know that they are highly important, that their function in the enterprise is\nessential for the successful development of the CCU payload. Information Centrality measures on\nthose two stakeholders are able to provide a better picture of their relative position in the network.\nIn fact, using this metric they are ranked 24 and 25 among the 36 CCU's stakeholders. In our view\nthese are more correct values since both stakeholders maintain a single but strong relationship with\nthe most central stakeholder in the network (Payload Systems). This is to say that if those\nrelationships get disrupted the whole network will functionally suffer somehow. Hence, we assert\nthat this metric is better able to capture the way in which stakeholders are functionally organized\nwhile still providing a good structural view of the network.\nTable 13\nOne might argue that because we have calculated information centralities using the relationship\nindices as input data, the results will be biased when compared to the other structural measures.\nUsing UCINET we have calculated degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities using valued\nrelationships and have found that the rankings for PSI Employees and PSI Owner are still very\nlow, i.e. they show very low centrality indices. On the other hand, we have calculated the\ninformation centrality measures using the adjacency matrix as input instead of the relationship\nindices. We have found similar results in the sense that centralities for those two stakeholders end\nup being very low. These calculations confirm that using valued relationships together with the\nproposed information centrality metric produce better determination of the functional position of\nstakeholders in the network.\n\n- 140 -\n\nCCU enterprise qualitative models\nWater Drop Model\nFigure 16 presents the water-drop model corresponding to the CCU enterprise system. The\ndiagram shows a firm-centric view of the CCU enterprise where Payload Systems Inc. is depicted\nat the center of the stakeholders system. PSI Employees, one of the main stakeholders of the CCU\nenterprise are not depicted explicitly as a stakeholder group but rather occupying all the positions\nat the center of the figure, those corresponding to the different internal functional organizations of\nthe firm. Around Payload Systems all its primary stakeholder groups were represented as\nmaintaining more or less collaborative relationships with the firm. As explained in Chapter 5,\noverlapping circles are representative of the collaboration and cooperation degree among\nstakeholders. Arrows connecting two stakeholder groups are indicative of a more formal,\ncontractual, or utilitarian based type of relationship. This is the case, for example, of Class C\nSuppliers that exchange necessary goods and services with Payload Systems in exchange of\nfinancial resources, but they do so after formal purchase orders or service contracts.\nAltogether Payload Systems and all its primary stakeholders form a closely-knit enterprise that\njointly works to create value for the whole CCU enterprise. The relatively small size of the\ncompany and the characteristics of the CCU payload it develops for space research activities\ndemand a highly collaborative enterprise system.\nMuch less visible or relevant Stakeholders such as Media, Taxpayers/Society, US Congress, and\nUS Federal Government occupy a secondary position in this firm-centric view of the CCU\nenterprise, although they definitely are in Payload Systems' radar screen. In fact, these stakeholders\ndo not affect CCU project's daily operations but provide the necessary support - both financial\nand societal - to the CCU enterprise system.\nOverall this representation allows abstracting many of the details of the relationships among\nstakeholders concentrating on the main stakeholder groups and the way they collaborate or\ninteract in relation with the value creation processes of the enterprise.\n\n- 141 -\n\nFigure 16: CCU Stakeholders - Water Drop Model representation\n\nNetwork Model\nDrawing a network model like the one proposed in Chapter 5 for the CCU stakeholder network\nconsidering its dimensions, both in number of stakeholders and relationships, is a challenging task.\nFortunately, we found that UCINET is able to depict a very similar representation to the one we\nhave proposed. The software provides several configurable options not only to adjust the graphical\nelements but also to define the position of the stakeholders within the network map.\n\n- 142 -\n\nFigure 17 shows the Multidimensional Scaling representation provided by UCINET's NetDraw\ntool corresponding to CCU's stakeholder network. Circles represent each one of the 36\nstakeholders in the CCU enterprise. Their relative size is proportional to each stakeholder's\nSalience Index. The lines connecting the circles represent the relationships among stakeholders and\ntheir width is proportional to the strength of the relationship as indicated by the Relationship\nSalience Indices.\n\nFigure 17: CCU Stakeholders - Network Model representation\nBeyond the confusion generated by the large number of intersecting lines in this network\nrepresentation it is still possible to extract some conclusions from it. First of all, this representation\nallows the rapid detection of which of the stakeholders are the most central (powerful) in the CCU\nenterprise system. The size of the circles and the widths of the lines both are indicative of\nstakeholders and relationships' relevance. It is clearly seen in the figure that Payload Systems (S01),\n\n- 143 -\n\nHabitat Development Group Head (S02), and CCU Habitat Development (S03) are the most\nrelevant stakeholders. They not only have important stakes into play that give them high salience\nin the network, but also they maintain a myriad of important relationships with other stakeholders\nin the network. As such they occupy the center of the network model representation.\nLess central stakeholders showing much lower Salience Indices and/or lower Relationship Salience\nIndices are depicted in the periphery of the figure indicating their less demanding or powerful\nposition in the CCU stakeholder network. This is the case, for example, of Other Habitats\nDevelopment Groups (S04), Media (S31), Taxpayers/Society (S30), and Class C Suppliers (S27)\nstakeholders among many others.\nAlso, we can clearly see in this representation why Payload Systems' Employees (S23) and Owner\n(S24) both deserve a more central role in the network as it was indicated by their information\ncentrality measures. Their corresponding Salience Indices - the importance of their stakes at risk in\nthe CCU enterprise, and Relationship Salience Indices are in both cases high. Also, they are clearly\nconnected to the most central stakeholder in the network that is precisely Payload Systems (S01).\nAlthough they are not depicted in a more central position with respect of less central stakeholders\nthey are visually embossed by the size of the circle representing each stakeholder and the width of\nthe lines connecting them to the rest of the network.\nUCINET via a related application, Mage 3D, also allows for the construction of a 3D dynamic\nrepresentation of stakeholders or any other type of network. The graph can be rotated and\nzoomed in real time to better visualize the structure and the stakeholders' relative positions in the\nnetwork. For obvious reasons we cannot include such a representation in this document, hence we\nencourage the reader to explore the additional options contained in this software package.\n\n- 144 -\n\nC H A P T E R 8\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nIn every enterprise environment the most central stakeholders are not very difficult to identify.\nThey are the more active, visible, or powerful groups that urgently claim their stakes at risk in the\nenterprise. Their \"voice\" is heard in every aisle of the extended enterprise. Less visible or tacit\ngroups that may very well influence on the enterprise operations and strategies are much more\ndifficult to recognize as salient stakeholders. Not only that, but also recognizing how all those\nstakeholders are structurally and functionally organized in the enterprise to accomplish its value\ncreation processes is a hard task.\nIn this thesis work we have been able to develop several new methodologies to address the above\nmentioned issues that, when combined with known techniques and tools, altogether provide new\ncapabilities for the analysis and understanding of stakeholder systems. Among the methods and\ntools we have developed and explored are:\n3⁄4 Two qualitative frameworks to visually represent and understand stakeholder systems\n3⁄4 A stakeholder identification methodology that is consistent with the value creation\nframework proposed by the Lean Aerospace Initiative\n3⁄4 A stakeholder salience quantification methodology\n3⁄4 A relationship intensity quantification methodology\n3⁄4 Several different measures associated with stakeholder networks' structural and\nfunctional complexities\n3⁄4 A DSM approach for analyzing stakeholder networks\n\n- 145 -\n\nWe have applied and tested all these methods in a real case application example: Payload Systems\nInc., a Cambridge based company devoted to the development of space application payloads.\nUsing this real case scenario we have demonstrated how to use the developed and proposed tools\nto the study of stakeholder systems, and have showed the weaknesses and strengths to map this\nkind of systems.\nThe social network analysis methodologies we have used in this thesis have proven to be effective\nfor the determination of stakeholder networks' structural characteristics. Although these\nmethodologies were almost all based on the mere presence or absence of relationships among\nactors, they still provided useful information for understanding some of the stakeholder network's\ncharacteristics. However, social network analysis methodologies fall short of providing a good\nassessment of the functional characteristics and complexity of the stakeholder network. Because\nthe functional characteristics of stakeholders and their relationships are not considered in the\nanalysis, the results obtained lack of any behavioral content. We have proposed additions to the\nsocial network methodologies to attempt rectifying this inherent problem. The distinction between\nstakeholder systems' structural and functional complexities and their treatment is one of the most\nimportant conclusions of this thesis.\nThe validity of the DSM methodology for the analysis of stakeholder systems has also been\ndemonstrated. Partitioning and clustering operations allowed us to discover relevant functional\ngroups within a stakeholder system. Moreover, the DSM clearly showed patterns of relationships\nwithin and among those groups.\nThe implications of this thesis work for the implementation of lean enterprise initiatives are quite\nevident. Firstly, the stakeholder identification and prioritization process we have described is\nessential to map an enterprise's stakeholder system. Obtaining such maps implies understanding\nthe extended enterprise composition, which in turn is necessary to assess the value creation\nprocesses of the integrated enterprise. Secondly, understanding structural and functional patterns\nwithin the stakeholder network will allow discovering sources of waste within the enterprise\nsystem that typically hinder the implementation of lean principles and practices. Lastly, assessing\n\n- 146 -\n\nthe stakeholder network's characteristics will help in creating sound and robust value propositions\nfor each and every stakeholder participating in the enterprise. Most importantly, stakeholder\nsystems analysis will allow for the implementation of balanced value propositions in which every\nstakeholder will receive a fair payoff for its contributions to the enterprise.\nWith respect to the future developments related with the contents of this thesis we can mention\nthose that derive from two major assumptions we made in our analysis of stakeholder networks:\n3⁄4 The links between any two stakeholders are balanced relationships in which both\nparties obtain a fair value from their corresponding contributions to the enterprise.\nThe value flowing in both directions along those relationships is in equilibrium.\n3⁄4 The intensity of the relationship between any two stakeholders is defined by the\nsalience of each one of the stakeholders as defined by their corresponding attributes of\npower, legitimacy, and criticality\nThe first assumption allowed us to consider the relationships between stakeholders as being\nsymmetrical which for certain stakeholder systems might not be the case, especially during\ntransitory states. For instance, in situations where a certain stakeholder is trying to gain a more\ncentral position in the stakeholder network it may be providing more value to other stakeholders\nthan the value it is receiving or will receive in the future from its contributions. The study of this\ntype of asymmetrical relationships is an area for future development.\nThe second assumption allowed for a simple way to assign values to the relationships between\nstakeholders and the use of those values for analyzing the structure and functionality of the\nstakeholder network. However, relationships between human organizations are hardly as linear as\nwe have assumed. New or enhanced ways of valuing relationships among stakeholders will have to\nbe studied.\nThere exist a myriad of methods for social network analysis and other graph theoretic calculations\nthat we have not explored in this thesis work due to the lack of time or space to explain them\n\n- 147 -\n\nproperly. Hence, another area of further development will be the study of other techniques and\nnew ways for measuring structural as well as functional complexity in stakeholder networks. A very\ntempting one is the study of communication systems theory and their entropy measure as a way of\ncharacterizing stakeholder network's functional complexity.\nAlthough we have repeatedly said that the analysis of stakeholder networks is a dynamic process,\none that must be repeated frequently to capture variability in the components of the network, we\nhave performed our analysis assuming that the stakeholder network was a stationary system.\nStudying the dynamics of stakeholder systems, possibly by making use of system dynamic models,\nis another interesting area for future development. These system dynamic models will allow\nanswering questions such as how the stakeholder system would respond to the addition or\nelimination of one or more stakeholders, and how strengthening some strategic relationships\nwould affect the enterprise system.\n\n- 148 -\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBaranger M., Chaos, Complexity, and Entropy: A physics talk for non-physicists,\nhttp://necsi.org/projects/baranger/cce.html\n\nBar-Yam Y., Dynamics of Complex System' (Reading MA: Addison-Wesley, 1997)\n\nBorgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G. and Freeman, L.C., UCINET for Windows: Software for Social Network\nAnalysis (Harvard: Analytic Technologies, 2002)\n\nBrandenburger A.M. and Nalebuff B.J., Co-opetition (New York: Currency and Doubleday, 1998)\n\nChristensen C.M., The Innovator's Dilemma (Boston: HarperBusiness, 2000)\n\nCarroll A.B. and Buchholtz A.K., Business & Society: Ethics and Stakeholder Management, 5th edition\n(Ohio: South-Western, 2003)\n\nDonaldson T. and Preston L.E., The Stakeholder Theory of the Corporation: Concepts, Evidence, and\nImplications, Academy of Management Review, Vol. 20, No. 1, pp. 65-91, 1995\n\nDoz Y.L. and Hamel G., Alliance Advantage: The Art of Creating Value through Partnering (Boston:\nHarvard Business School Press, 1998)\n\nEppinger S.D., Innovation at the Speed of Information, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 79, No. 1, pp.\n149-158, 2001\n\nEppinger S.D., and Salminen V., Patterns of Product Development Interactions, International Conference\non Engineering Design, ICED 01 Glasgow, August 2001\n\nEppinger S.D., Whitney D.E., Smith R.P., and Gebala D.A., A Model-Based Method for Organizing\nTasks in Product Development, Research in Engineering Design, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 1-13, 1994\n\nFreeman L., Visualizing Social Groups, American Statistical Association, 1999 Proceedings of the\nSection on Statistical Graphics, pp. 47-54, 2000\n\nFreeman R.E., Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach (Boston: Pitman, 1984)\n\nFrooman J., Stakeholder Influence Strategies, Academy of Management Review, Vol. 24, No. 2, pp.\n191-205, 1999\n\n- 149 -\n\n- 150 -\nKochan T.A. and Rubinstein S.A., Toward a Stakeholder Theory of the Firm: The Saturn Partnership,\nOrganization Science, Vol. 11, No. 4, pp. 367-386, July-August 2000\n\nKuhn H.W. and Nasar S., The Essential John Nash (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2002)\n\nMaier M.W. and Rechtin E., The Art of Systems Architecting, 2nd edition (Boca Raton: CRC Press,\n2002)\n\nMitchell R.K., Agle B.

      "content": "Executive Summary\nResearch overview\nThe research herein covers lean enterprise transformation in the aerospace industry,\nconducted under the auspices of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Lean\nAerospace Initiative (LAI). Leading indicators of lean enterprise transformation, as\nmeasured by the Lean Enterprise Self-Assessment Tool (LESAT), are studied as a means\nfor informing management decisions for achieving and accelerating the transformation\nprocess. Arguments from literature are made in support of the assumption that a leaner\nenterprise can outperform a less lean enterprise. This study uses cross-sectional and time\nseries LESAT data, along with directed interview data, to disprove the null hypotheses\nassociated with each of the following primary hypotheses, namely:\nH1) Enterprises that exhibit a greater value of lean enterprise\nTransformation and Leadership Process maturity will exhibit a greater\nvalue of lean Lifecycle Process maturity\nH2) Enterprises that exhibit a greater value of lean enterprise\nTransformation and Leadership Process maturity will exhibit a greater\nvalue of lean Enabling Infrastructure Process maturity\nH3) Enterprises that exhibit a greater value of lean Enabling Infrastructure\nProcess maturity will exhibit a greater value of lean Lifecycle Process\nmaturity\nLESAT data was collected from a total of 31 enterprises from the US and UK aerospace\nindustry. Each enterprise data set consisted of an average of eleven individual\nassessments conducted by senior enterprise leadership committee members. Enterprises\nin this study were considered to be business units, divisions, or sites that had profit and\nloss (P&L) accountability for some set of aerospace products or services.\nMain Findings\n- 1 -\n\nThe LESAT tool was not designed to be a benchmarking tool, and as such no average\nindustry lean enterprise maturity data is reported in this thesis. The data does, however,\nallow for the rank ordering of lean enterprise practices. This ranking provides several\ninsights into the current state of lean enterprise transformation maturity in the aerospace\nindustry. First, the industry exhibits its lowest maturity in practices related to crafting and\ndeploying the lean enterprise vision, even though it does exhibit high maturity in lean\nproduction. Second, integration of lean in strategic planning (LESAT practice I.A.1)\nranked highly, suggesting that enterprise strategic planners are considering lean as one of\ntheir operating tools. Yet, leveraging lean capability for business growth (LESAT\npractice II.A.1) and impacting enterprise strategic planning (LESAT practice I.G.5)\nranked low. This suggests that the actual benefits realized with lean are not informing the\nstrategic planning process. This would indicate a potential open-loop management system\nthat \"considers\" lean in strategic planning, but does not strategically build plans based on\nthe gains that lean is actually providing the enterprise.\nThe empirical data in this thesis supports the three primary hypotheses by showing strong\ncorrelations in each of the three proposed relationships (H1, H2, and H3). Additional\nevidence suggests that the causal inference associated with these hypotheses may exist.\nThe implications for industry are that lean enterprise change efforts must have mature\nleadership/transformation processes in order to improve the maturity of lifecycle\nprocesses and enabling infrastructure. Maturity in these processes will lead to improved\nP&L results and better enterprise stakeholder value delivery, all else being equal.\nA subdivision of the leadership/transformation variable indicates that leadership\ncommitment (LC) is an essential prerequisite for establishing a lean change environment\n(CE), which in turn enables detailed lean change activities to occur in practice (CP).\nThese variables represent the three major cycles of the LAI Transition-to-Lean (TTL)\nroadmap, namely the entry/reentry cycle, the long-term cycle, and the short-term cycle.\nEmpirical evidence supports the causal inference between these variables. Further\nanalysis also suggests that the current structuring of the TTL is a logical way to organize\n- 2 -\n\nand prioritize lean enterprise transformation activities, and should produce better results\nthan an ad-hoc improvement process.\nThe new knowledge associated with this thesis suggests that the creation of formal\nmanagement information feedback, associated with lean enterprise change activities, is\nnecessary for achieving lean enterprise transformation. Furthermore, the structuring of\nimprovement activities within this information feedback model, as shown in\nFigure 1, may lead to the acceleration of the lean enterprise transformation compared to\nan enterprise that does not establish the information feedback loops. The recommendation\nfor enterprises attempting lean enterprise transformation is to begin by establishing\nleadership anxiety or desire for lean enterprise transformation. This will help establish\nstrong leadership commitment. Next, a lean office or group should be established. If there\nis an existing continuous improvement office, then the lean group should be incorporated\nas part of this office. Lean transformation efforts need to be supported as part of regular\nenterprise operations. If the lean office is considered a separate entity working on the\nsidelines, and not viewed as a strategic resource, then the transformation efforts will face\nserious resistance as they inherently cross functional, process, and corporate management\nboundaries. The Transition to Lean (TTL) Roadmap, or a modified version thereof,\nshould be used as a guide for organizing and sequencing lean enterprise transformation\nactivities. Finally, the lean enterprise transformation information feedback connections\nidentified in\nFigure 1 must be established and managed as part of normal enterprise operating\nprocedures. These feedback mechanisms will ensure that there is continued awareness\nand support for the transformation, and that the gains associated with the transformation\nare utilized to the enterprise's best strategic advantage. Enterprises operating in this\nmanner will be better positioned to outperform their competitors.\n- 3 -\n\nAnxiety/Desire for\nNeed to Create a\nLean Enterprise\nAnxiety/Desire for\nNeed to Create a\nLean Enterprise\nCatch-Up\nCatch-Up\nSurpass\nSurpass\nStay Ahead\nStay Ahead\nExternal\nPressure for\nthe Lean\nEnterprise\nExperience\nwith Lean\nExperience\nwith Lean\nLean\nEducation\nand\nTraining\nLean\nEducation\nand\nTraining\nInternal\nPressure\nfor the\nLean\nEnterprise\nMaturity in\nLeadership\nCommitment\n(LC) to Lean\nEnterprise\nTransformation\nMaturity in\nLeadership\nCommitment\n(LC) to Lean\nEnterprise\nTransformation\nMaturity in\nCreating a Lean\nEnterprise\nChange\nEnvironment\n(CE)\nMaturity in\nCreating a Lean\nEnterprise\nChange\nEnvironment\n(CE)\nMaturity in\nEstablishing\nLean\nEnterprise\nChange in\nPractice (CP)\nMaturity in\nEstablishing\nLean\nEnterprise\nChange in\nPractice (CP)\nEnterprise Strategic Planning\nEnterprise Strategic Planning\nLean Enterprise Transformation Activities\nMulti-\nStakeholder Value\nDelivery\nMulti-\nStakeholder Value\nDelivery\nLean Maturity in\nEnterprise Lifecycle\nProcesses (Revenue\nGenerators)\nLean Maturity in\nEnterprise Lifecycle\nProcesses (Revenue\nGenerators)\nLean Maturity in\nEnterprise Enabling\nInfrastructure Processes\n(Cost Centers)\nLean Maturity in\nEnterprise Enabling\nInfrastructure Processes\n(Cost Centers)\nEnterprise P&L\nExternal\nFactors\nExternal\nFactors\nBuild on\nLean\nCapabilities\nBuild on\nLean\nCapabilities\nAssess Lean\nEnterprise\nMaturity\nAssess Lean\nEnterprise\nMaturity\nLESAT\nSection I\nLESAT\nSections II&III\nTrack Multi-\nStakeholder Value\nDelivery\nTrack Multi-\nStakeholder Value\nDelivery\nPrioritize\nImprovement\nPlans\nPrioritize\nImprovement\nPlans\nA\nB\nC\nE\nD\nF\nG\nH\nI\nFigure 1 - Proposed lean enterprise transformation information feedback model.\nBarriers to Adoption\nThe most obvious barrier to adopting this model for lean enterprise transformation is that\nit requires leadership commitment. While there is evidence that local lean efforts may\nsucceed at improving local performance metrics, there is no evidence that lean enterprise\ntransformation can occur without leadership support, as the change efforts necessarily\ncross functional, process, and corporate management boundaries. The \"islands of\nsuccess\" discussed in this thesis highlight the fact that a major limiting factor in\n- 4 -\n\nexpanding local lean improvement efforts has been the need to go beyond the\nmanagement authority of the local leader.\nThe next barrier is that successful lean implementation will require the establishment of a\nlean change office (or a lean team within a continuous improvement office). This\nnecessarily means the allocation of scarce resources to lean efforts. This team must then\nmanage, track, and provide information feedback to enterprise leadership that enables\nthem to make strategic decisions with respect to the lean capabilities of the enterprise. If\nthe lean efforts are viewed as a \"flavor of the month\" improvement program, establishing\nthese feedback mechanisms as part of routine enterprise operations may have little\nsupport. In the event that the management environment is supportive of lean enterprise\ntransformation, the lean change team must be adequately prepared to understand and\ndeploy lean, and have the ability and authority to help change organizational behavior at\nall levels of the enterprise. This is perhaps the single hardest element of the\ntransformation puzzle, especially as it means redefining employee attitudes, roles, duties,\nincentives, and even promotion paths. All of these efforts will encounter resistance to\nchange, and unless that resistance can be overcome, the change efforts will not take hold.\nFinally, if lean transformation is viewed as a pure cost cutting initiative, it will encounter\nserious resistance from the workforce and will not lead to any long-term strategic\nimprovements for the company.\nRecognizing that the gains achieved with lean\ntransformation can help produce long-term capabilities and returns for the enterprise may\nbe the most fundamental piece of knowledge that leadership needs to embrace in order to\nenable and accelerate lean enterprise transformation.\n- 5 -"

      "content": "Using Stakeholder Value Analysis to Build Exploration\nSustainability\n*\n**\nEric S. Rebentisch , Edward F. Crawley+, Geilson Loureiro++, John Q. Dickmann§, and Sandro N. Catanzaro\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139\nAbstract: The sustainability of space exploration will depend in large part on its ability to\nconsistently and reliably deliver valued benefits to societal stakeholders over an extended\nperiod. This on-going research studies the values of prospective stakeholders in the space\nexploration enterprise--both in the near term and with a perspective extending over\ndecades. The immediate focus is human and robotic exploration of the Earth/Moon system,\nbut extends to the exploration of Mars as well. Potential beneficiaries of space exploration\nare identified in broad societal sectors. An analysis of these stakeholders, their values and\nneeds leads to the development of a comprehensive set of space exploration objectives that\naddress those needs. The relative priority of exploration objectives is weighted using\ninformation about stakeholder characteristics, values, and their role and place in the\nexploration value stream. The weighted exploration objectives can then be used to assess the\nrelative value of different technical system architectures, and to design exploration\nenterprise architecture, attributes and policy frameworks to enable value delivery to societal\nstakeholders. Ultimately, through stakeholders' continuing support, sustainable space\nexploration will be delivered.\nI. Introduction\nA critical aspect of future space exploration must involve considerations of sustainability. Technical success\nalone cannot ensure that space exploration will have the continuing societal support necessary over the course of\ndecades to develop enduring and expanding exploration capabilities. To ensure that the exploration system is\nsustainable, it must also produce valued outputs (e.g., knowledge) and deliver them to a wide spectrum of societal\nbeneficiaries (such as the public). All stakeholders must be aware of the benefit and of its delivery. This flow of\nvalued benefits to stakeholders is the exploration value delivery system.\nBesides the flow of valued benefits to stakeholders, there are at least three other factors that contribute to\nsustainability. Policy robustness addresses the way in which the exploration enterprise interacts with its external\nenvironment, including key government resource-providers, so as to assure continuing support for exploration\nactivities. Next, risks of exploration must be understood, explicitly minimized, and residual risk clearly\ncommunicated to all stakeholders. Finally, the exploration system must be affordable, its multiple elements\nacquired and operated within a realistic budget. The combination of value, policy robustness, risk management, and\naffordability contribute to assuring that societal stakeholders will be informed of the costs and benefits of space\nexploration, and that benefits exceeding costs will be delivered to them consistently over the period of years and\ndecades required to achieve a robust exploration capability.\nWe propose that a sustainable exploration value delivery system results from deliberate design decisions, and\nthat those design decisions are best realized through an understanding of the system's stakeholders, their values and\nneeds. Once values and needs are identified, system objectives can be defined, leading to the development of\nspecific architecture choices not only for the exploration technical system, but also for the exploration enterprise and\n* Research Associate, Center for Technology, Policy, and Industrial Development, 77 Massachusetts Ave.\n+ Professor, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 77 Massachusetts Ave., AIAA Fellow.\n++ Post-doctoral Associate, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 77 Massachusetts Ave.\n§ Research Assistant, Engineering Systems Division, 77 Massachusetts Ave.\n** Research Assistant, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 77 Massachusetts Ave.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\noperating concept, as well as its policy environment. The exploration enterprise includes the core set of explorers,\nscientists, and engineers that realize and execute the space exploration campaign. It also includes the extended\ngroup of stakeholders who are not directly involved in the exploration campaign, but who are nevertheless crucial in\nproviding support and funding. This enterprise architecture and operating concept includes core government\norganizations and extended network of affiliated suppliers; designated responsibilities, authority, and accountability\namong enterprise stakeholders; the culture and artifacts of high reliability operations; the structures, policies, and\ntools for evolutionary system and evolutionary system of systems (SoS) development; and the necessary\ninfrastructure to enable completion of primary missions and to provide robust exploration capability over an\nextended period.\nThis paper is an interim report of the development and application of a process for designing an enterprise value\ndelivery system, including development of the necessary background information. It is best characterized as the first\nspiral in a multi-spiral development effort, the ultimate objective of which is the development of techniques for\nexpanding the repertoire of tools and techniques available to system and enterprise architects. While this discussion\nis focused specifically on the space exploration value delivery system, we are confident the concepts can be applied\ngenerally. We begin with a discussion of the stakeholders in the exploration enterprise and their stated, revealed or\nimplied needs. This is followed by a process for translating those needs into specific exploration objectives. From\nthose objectives, a process for establishing priorities is demonstrated. From prioritized objectives, the development\nof specific technical, enterprise, and policy architectures is shown. Examples from the underlying research are\nprovided throughout to illustrate the steps in the process.\nII. A Stakeholder Value Approach\nStakeholders are the core constituents of the exploration enterprise. They provide resources, support, employees,\ntechnologies, and ultimately govern its activities. It is fitting that we begin our analysis with them. We look to\nexisting research on stakeholder theory to help frame the inquiry and identify specific processes for identifying\nspace exploration stakeholders and their needs.\nA. Stakeholder Theory\nResurgence of stakeholder theory as a governance and management approach is attributed to R. E. Freeman's\narguments in his Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach1 . This work spawned two decades of theorizing\nand research on the subject. Since then theoretical and empirical work has centered on diverse approaches to\nunderstanding the proper role of stakeholders, stakeholder management and the relationship of these concepts to\nethics, performance, and other factors relating to enterprises. Freeman summarized the thrust of his work: \"if\norganizations want to be effective, they will pay attention to all and only those relationships that can affect or be\naffected by the achievement of the organization's purpose.\"2\nThe fundamental issue in stakeholder theory centers on the proper basis for management and governance of\nenterprises. It boils down to the question: \"What is the best way to govern [an enterprise]?\"3 Traditionalists tend to\nadvocate a single valued objective function approach, which results in maximization of shareholder value as the\nmeasure of success. Stakeholder theorists argue that this guideline is too narrow and exclusive, that it does not\nallow managers to address effectively the multiplicity of interests that inevitably impact and are impacted by an\nenterprise. We agree and for the purposes of this research strive to preserve transparency on as much information\nabout stakeholders and their needs as possible through the on-going analysis. This position generates many\nquestions such as: \"How are stakeholders identified?\", \"How are their needs discovered?\", \"How does management\nadjudicate when inevitable conflicts in stakeholder interests arise?\", \"How fine grained should stakeholders be\ndivided?\", \"How can enterprise management judge whether their performance is benefiting stakeholders in the most\nefficient or effective way possible?\" become central.\nUnfortunately, despite many years of effort, researchers have been unable to definitively test stakeholder theory4.\nIn addition to empirical difficulties, researchers have been unable to converge on consistent definitions and\nconceptualizations of stakeholders, stakeholder theory, or stakeholder management5, . Some have argued that much\nof this debate is clouded by ideological and philosophical views on the legitimate purpose of enterprises in society,\nspecifically profit-seeking enterprises, with emphasis on the relationship of stakeholder theory to business ethics7, 8,\n9, 10, 11.. There is research that addresses these questions, but no consensus as yet on the utility or validity of it. In\naddition, it is not apparent that the compendium of research and theorizing addresses other pertinent issues such as\nhow stakeholder interactions with each other may or may not influence whatever enterprise objective function(s)\narise from application of stakeholder theory and management. In general, past research provides no clear-cut\nguidance on a process to identify and assess stakeholders and their needs.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nOur purpose is practical and narrow: \"How can we architect a public enterprise that must accommodate\nnumerous (possibly conflicting) views and ideas about how it should achieve its defined mission?\" Indeed, over the\ncourse of the exploration enterprise's life-span its mission may change because of stakeholder actions and\ninteractions. So we must ask and answer for ourselves questions such as \"Who are the stakeholders?\"; \"How can we\ngain insight into their interests and values?\"; and \"How can we simultaneously address what are certain to be\nconflicting interests and values among the various stakeholder groups?\" This focus eliminates a number of areas of\nprior study on stakeholders.\nIntuitively, we believe that the relationships between various stakeholders generates additional dynamics that\nextend beyond the collective group, dynamics not directly addressed by stakeholder theory but which are an\nimportant part of the value exchange relationships that exist in extended enterprises. Evolving research on Lean\nEnterprises (to which some of the authors are party) provides some guidance. Murman, et al12., defines a lean\nenterprise as \"an integrated entity that efficiently creates value for its multiple stakeholders by employing lean\nprinciples and practices.\" The concept of Lean has more traditionally been associated with manufacturing and the\nToyota Production System13. However, the evolving and expanding definition of Lean has grown to encompass\nentire organization systems where the ultimate goal is to have an enterprise that is \"dynamic, knowledge driven and\ncustomer focused...continuously evolving with its environment, seeking improvement and perfection14.\" One of the\nprimary tools in lean enterprise research is value stream mapping, a direct correlate to the exploration value delivery\nsystem mentioned previously. Enterprise value stream mapping identifies stakeholders, their relationships to one\nanother, their needs and relevant attributes. We draw on these evolving tools and concepts from the lean enterprise\nliterature as a starting point for this analysis.\nThe additional challenge posed by the space exploration enterprise is that it is large, extensive, and not all\nstakeholders relate to each other in a hierarchical or contractual fashion as they might in a business enterprise. Each\nstakeholder can uniquely influence other stakeholders and the overall exploration activity depending on how directly\nthey are involved, how they relate to the others, and what roles they play. Kochan and Rubenstein15 identify two\ngeneral classes of stakeholders: definitive and latent. According to Kochan and Rubenstein there are three key\ncriteria for categorizing stakeholders: (1) Stakeholders must hold assets that are critical to the enterprise's success;\n(2) Stakeholders must put their assets at risk in the enterprise; (3) Stakeholders must have sufficient power to\ncompel influence. In Kochan and Rubenstein's framework, stakeholders must meet all three criteria to be classed as\na definitive stakeholder, otherwise they are latent. In our work we replace the adjective \"definitive\" with \"direct\"\nand \"latent\" with \"indirect\". Whether a stakeholder is direct or indirect will become an important consideration later\nas we attempt to prioritize needs.\nB. Exploration Stakeholders\nUsing these concepts to identify stakeholder groups, we identified thirty-two groups at the beginning of our\nanalysis. These ranged in size and character from the relatively small and focused \"Space Crew Explorer\" group to\nmore diffuse groups such as \"Public\" and \"Media\". As our analysis proceeded, it became increasingly difficult to\naddress enterprise and exploration objectives effectively for this limited, but large, number of stakeholders. In\naddition, we discovered that many stakeholder needs were similar to other stakeholders or overlapped with each\nother. For these reasons we aggregated into more general stakeholder groups. For example, the many US\ngovernment agencies which may be considered stakeholders were aggregated into a group called \"Other USG\nAgencies\", commercial enterprises with different interests were grouped as \"Commercial enterprises\" and the space\ncrew, earth operator and scientist explorers were grouped as \"Explorers\".\nFrom this aggregation, we obtained thirteen stakeholder groups. These stakeholders constituted the core group\non which we performed our analysis of needs and developed exploration objectives. Even with this reduced\nnumber, the task of integrating and tracking values and needs to stakeholder objectives required further aggregation.\nFor the technical system and enterprise architecture analyses that will be explained later, it is helpful to have even\nfewer categories of stakeholders. To that end, we identified five general categories of societal interests, which are\nlisted in Table 1. These categories include both direct and indirect stakeholders of space exploration. Table 1 shows\nthe relationship between the top level societal interest groups and the stakeholders we identified. Note that some of\nthe stakeholders appear in multiple interest categories. This is not surprising, given that any stakeholder group\nrepresents an amalgam of complex motives and interests.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nExploration\nScience\nEconomic\nSecurity\nPublic\nExplorers\nScientists\nCommercial\nDoD\nUS Public\nEngineers\nNASA\nNASA\nOther USG\nenterprises\nOther USG Agencies\nIntelligence\nInternational\nMedia\nEducators\nAgencies\nEngineers\nPartners\nExecutive Branch\nCongress\nNASA\nTable 1. Societal interest groups for space exploration.\nC. Stakeholder value identification\nStarting with our earliest identification of stakeholders (the list of thirty-two), we undertook a comprehensive\nsearch to identify values and stated needs. For some stakeholders, the values and needs data were relatively\nabundant or easy to find; others were more challenging. For example, the President, as a representative of the\nExecutive Branch of government as well as the American Public, has clearly stated his values in \"A Renewed Spirit\nof Discovery\", the current Administration's vision for space exploration16. Congress (and, by proxy, the Public)\nhave also identified their values, stated in the Space\nIdentify stakeholders\nAct of 1958 (as amended), in, addition to the\nplethora of public opinion and polling data over the\nIdentify stakeholder types\ndecades of the U. S. Space Program. For other\nstakeholders, such as some government agencies,\nIdentify needs for each stakeholder type\ndefining needs was more difficult. For example,\nIdentify neutral operand, neutral process, specific operand and\nthe Department of Energy is classified as an\nspecific process by using OPM for each identified need\nindirect stakeholder and identifying its needs\nrequired research into budgetary and strategy\nAnalyze, group, structure and reword objectives to\ndocuments and inference of needs based on the\nderive a list of overarching exploration objectives\ncontents of these documents. The stakeholder\nvalues and stated needs formed the starting point\nDevelop weighting factors for\noverarching exploration objectives\nfor our development of exploration objectives.\nAs an example, our analysis of the Executive\nBranch/President as a stakeholder group, identified Figure 1.Defining preference-ordered objectives from\nnine different needs deriving from history, stakeholder needs.\nlegislation (Space Act), the current Space Vision\nand other data such as public opinion polls and archives of past Presidential statements and actions regarding the\nSpace Program. From these sources, we developed the following \"needs\" for the Executive Branch/President:\npromote economic growth; demonstrate national leadership (maintain and grow political capital); maintain national\nsecurity; demonstrate global leadership (maintain and grow international political capital); show progress on the\nSpace Vision; demonstrate good stewardship of national treasure and U.S. interests; contribute to planetary\nprotection from extraterrestrial threats to existence (asteroids) and to get re-elected. At this point in the process, we\nidentified on the order of 100 specific needs statements for all stakeholders++.\nIII. Using Object-Process Methodology to Derive Exploration System Objectives\nHaving identified stakeholders and their needs, we then proceeded to identify the stakeholders' exploration-\nrelated objectives, to which the exploration technical architecture and value delivery system are to be designed. An\noverview of this process is shown in Figure 1. Object Process Methodology (OPM) was used to represent formally\nthe identified stakeholders, their needs, and various ways those needs could be met. OPM combines formal yet\nsimple graphics with natural language sentences to express the function, structure and behavior of systems in a\n++ Providing an approximate rather than definite number of stakeholder needs does not imply that this process lacks\nrigor. Stakeholder need identification is a highly iterative process and the number of specific stakeholder needs is\ndependent on the best-available information about that stakeholder at the time. Since needs and information about\nthem changes with time, and with evolving contexts, the categorization criteria generally change as well. Providing\na specific number of stakeholder needs would only provide a snapshot, which fails to convey the dynamic nature of\nthis research process.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nCheap & safe\naccess to orbit\nContracts\nsingle, integrated, model. It also allows us to flow from objectives through concepts to specific implementations (or\nform)17, 18 . The graphical models in OPM are called OPD (diagrams), with corresponding text-based descriptions of\nobjectives written in OPL\nOPL:\nOPD:\n(language).\nOPD is built\nfrom three basic types of\n-\nTo (neutral process)\nentities: objects, processes\n-\n[attribute of neutral\nand states, with objects and\nprocess]\nprocesses being higher-level\nbuilding blocks.\nObjects\n-\nthe (neutral operand)\ne x i s t\n( w i t h\ns t a t e\n-\nBy (specific process)\ndescriptions), and processes\n-\n[attribute of specific\ntransform\nobjects\nby\nprocess]\ngenerating, consuming or\n-\nusing (generic system\naffecting them.

For each stakeholder need,\nthe question is asked 'what should be transformed so that the stakeholder need can be addressed?'. The answer to\nthat question, in a 'value neutral' context derives the neutral operands. The neutral process acts upon the neutral\noperand in order to address the identified need. The specific process represents a way in which the neutral process\ncan be done. A specific process may also act upon a specific operand. A generic system concept is an instrument to\nrun a specific process. The specific system form is one instance of form the generic system concept may take.\nAttributes qualify a neutral and specific process but are not mandatory in order to derive the objective statement in\nOPL. The boxes with arrows are candidates for deriving metrics by which value delivery can be assessed. Using\nthis approach, a stakeholder and its needs, and corresponding ways by which those needs are satisfied can be\npresented in a compact visual form. Consequently, OPDs serve as a helpful communication device for architecting\nactivities. Later, these OPM artifacts can be automatically converted into executable architecture models, greatly\naiding architecture trade studies19, 20.\nFor each stakeholder, Object Process Diagrams were created to graphically illustrate their needs and likely ways\nthose needs would be met21. Figure 3 shows commercial space enterprises with a need for cheap and safe access to\norbit.\nThe OPD illustrates how this might be\naccomplished, with the resulting OPL: TO reduce\nentry barriers for businesses needing access to orbit\nBY developing the market for launch services.\nUsing this approach, the needs statements for the\n13 stakeholders were represented in OPD and OPL.\nFor each identified need, an OPL objective statement\nwas generated. For convenience and traceability, the\nneeds and resulting objectives were kept in a master\nspreadsheet. An excerpt from this spreadsheet is\nshown in Table 2. A stakeholder, its need, neutral\noperand, neutral process, specific operand and\nspecific process are identified. From these inputs the\nobjective statement is automatically composed,\nresulting in the master list of objectives for the 13\nFigure 3: Example of objective generation using OPM.\nstakeholders.\nCommercial\nenterprises\nSpace mining\nSpace Tourism\nLaunch service\nproviders\nInternational\nproviders\nNational\ncommercial\nEntry Barrier\nCost\nRisk\nReducing\nDeveloping\nMarket\nCheap & safe\naccess to orbit\nContracts\nSpace Comm\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nStakeholder\nNeed\nNeutral Operand\nNeutral\nProcess\nSpecific Operand\nSpecific\nProcess\nOPM objectives\nObjectives\nCommercial Space\nCheaper Space\nroutine inexpensive\nprovide\nSpace transportation\nbuilding\nTo provide routine inexpensive access to\nTo reduce entry barriers for businesses\nSpace Mining\nTransportation\naccess to the moon\ninfrastructure\nthe moon BY building Space transportation\nneeding access to orbit by developing the\nInfrastructure\ninfrastructure\nmarket for launch services\nCommercial Space\nCheaper Space\nroutine inexpensive\nprovide\nSpace transportation\nbuilding\nTo provide routine inexpensive access to\nSpace Tourism\nTransportation\naccess to leo\ninfrastructure\nleo BY building Space transportation\nInfrastructure\ninfrastructure\nCommercial Space\nCheaper Space\nroutine inexpensive\nprovide\nSpace transportation\nbuilding\nTO provide routine inexpensive access to\nSpace\nTransportation\naccess to LEO,\ninfrastructure\nLEO, MEO, GEO BY building Space\nCommunications\nInfrastructure\nMEO, GEO\ntransportation infrastructure\nDOD\nCheaper Space\nroutine inexpensive\nprovide\nwith commercial space\noperating\nTo provide routine inexpensive access to\nTransportation\nInfrastructure\naccess to LEO,\nMEO, GEO\ntransportation partners,\ninvesing in development,\nLEO, MEO, GEO BY operating with\ncommercial space transportation partners,\nmodifying federal\nregulations and NASA\ninvesing in development, modifying federal\nregulations and NASA launch policy\nlaunch policy\nDOD\nResponsiveSpace\nTransportation\nresponsive access to\nLEO, MEO, GEO\nprovide\nwith commercial space\ntransportation partners\noperating\nTo provide responsive access to LEO,\nMEO, GEO BY operating with commercial\nInfrastructure\nand evolved launch\nprocesses\nspace transportation partners and evolved\nlaunch processes\nTable 2: Traceability from stakeholder needs to overarching exploration objectives\nThe set of roughly 100 exploration objectives at the individual stakeholder level was seen to have a number of\nconsistencies and repetitive patterns, lending itself to clustering and aggregation. Consequently, similar objectives\nwere clustered together in like groups. Through content analysis, the intent of the objectives in each group was\ncaptured and articulated in a single overarching exploration objective statement. This reduced the number of\nexploration objectives to a more manageable 24, listed in Appendix A. The outcome of this process is illustrated in\nTable 2, where several similar stakeholder objectives are addressed by the overarching exploration objective \"To\nreduce entry barriers for businesses needing access to orbit by developing the market for launch services.\"\nA lesson learned from this analysis is that stakeholder objectives exist at different levels in what is ultimately a\nhierarchy of objectives. On-going analysis is employing a hierarchical objectives tree structure to more rigorously\ncluster stakeholder objectives and define overarching exploration objectives. An additional lesson learned is that\nthese overarching objectives statements are coupled with the context of the stakeholder in the value delivery system\nand with the functional forms in which these objectives will be met (e.g., the technical architecture of the\nexploration system). While the underlying needs of stakeholders don't change (at least in the short term), the way\nthey are categorized for this analysis may change as it becomes more clear how those needs will be addressed.\nConsequently, this is an iterative analysis process that benefits greatly from concurrency in the development of the\ntechnical, enterprise, and policy architectures and their roles in the overall value delivery system.\nIV. Developing a Precedence Order for Exploration Objectives\nThe scope of stakeholders included in this analysis revealed many different and not always aligned priorities\nwith regard to space exploration. Not all objectives that were identified can, or necessarily should, be completely\nmet. The creation of successful technical and enterprise architectures will require balancing the interests of some\nstakeholders with potentially competing interests of others. This challenge is compounded by the sheer number of\nstakeholders and objectives that must be considered. To define a single value delivery system (including, e.g.,\ntechnical architecture, etc.) that will meet those objectives, the architect must simultaneously consider the\nimportance of meeting the objective for the fundamental success of space exploration, and the value of meeting that\nobjective to the various stakeholders involved. The former consideration addresses principally the technical success\nof exploration activities, while the latter addresses the support and ultimately, sustainability of the exploration\nactivity over the long term. From these, one can place value, and hence relative priority on meeting specific\nexploration objectives. This section addresses considerations in prioritizing objectives relative to multiple\nstakeholders, and discusses the approach used here.\nResearch on approaches to define precedence ordered objectives when dealing with multiple stakeholders has\nbeen done for more than 50 years. One seminal result in the field is Arrow's Impossibility Theorem22, which states\nthat it is impossible to design a fair method for prioritizing objectives in a way that would obey every criterion\nrequired by a group of stakeholders. It specifically states that it is not possible to find a general method (compatible\nwith the non assessed context) to transform the preferences of more than 3 individuals into a global precedence\norder, without resorting to a dictator (someone who declares priorities by fiat.) Consequently, any attempts to define\nglobal preference sets can at best only approximate the collective interests of all stakeholders with some error, and\nwill likely benefit some stakeholders at the expense of others.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nWhile a perfect method does not exist, some attempts have been made to find compromise solutions. The\nAnalytic Hierarchy Process, or AHP is a preferred tool when it is possible to gather a group of people that are\naccepted as the ultimate decision makers for a system or concept23. The process builds a matrix of pairwise\ncomparisons of different objectives to be ranked, assigning weights to the relative importance of one over the other.\nThrough the eigenvalues of this matrix it is possible to find weights for the objectives and assess the consistency of\nthe comparisons themselves--it is self-diagnostic. The use of pairwise comparisons to create ordinal ranking is the\nprimary weakness of this approach. Decision-makers are inherently limited in the number of simultaneous\ncomparisons they can make. In order to accommodate large decision spaces with numerous objectives, hierarchical\nlayers must be imposed which can become unwieldy and potentially introduce sources of error. In this analysis,\nusing an AHP process would require roughly 280 comparisons for each stakeholder, resulting in over 3500 pairwise\ncomparisons. While theoretically sound, this approach presented significant problems that rendered it impractical in\nthis instance.\nMulti-attribute utility theory (MAUT) potentially relaxes the requirement for pairwise comparisons, overcoming\nthe significant challenge of large-scale systems. It addresses the challenge of multiple stakeholders through a\ndeliberative process where \"experts-representatives\" negotiate for needs they represent, and find consensus through\na group process . While encouraging, this process is best used where a relatively small number of stakeholder\nrepresentatives can directly negotiate a solution. The case of space exploration is particularly challenging because\nof the size of the endeavor, as well as the difficulty in representing broad stakeholder categories with a single expert.\nThe general identification of interests, objectives, policy trends, etc., for the stakeholder groups we are interested in\ncan be found in written documents, which allows for a deep and wide representation of stakeholder's objectives.\nHowever, finding real experts who would reflect the particular and complete perspective of each stakeholder and\nwho would be available for the extensive negotiations necessary to develop consensus would be impractical as well.\nBecause of the limitations in the previously-mentioned approaches, we used a Direct Assessment method of\nallocating points to each objective. This follows the techniques used for the Quality Function Deployment25 and\nseveral similar approaches to build a matrix to assess the strength of the benefit for each stakeholder/objective pair.\nWhile the Analytic Hierarchy Process was ruled out, we used a bilateral agreement technique among pairs of\nresearchers, asking pairs of researchers to derive the weights of the different objectives for each stakeholder. This\ntechnique is derived from research that shows that a bilateral agreement under some conditions is enough to\napproximate the consensus of a complete group26.\nDeciding what criteria to use to evaluate how much each stakeholder values a particular objective is not a simple\nproposition. A neoclassical economic perspective on value is that individuals' preferences (i.e., values) are only\nrevealed when they exchange one item for another. A transaction-based perspective on space exploration would\naddress not only the benefit that space exploration provides to a certain stakeholder, but also what that stakeholder\nprovides in return for that benefit. An example of this might be that the publicity associated with space exploration\nis valued enough by a firm that it is willing to underwrite the cost by providing fees for advertising in association\nwith a space mission. Given that exploration may unfold over time and stakeholders may not reciprocate for some\ntime, a temporal element should be added to a transaction-focused approach (net-present value calculations are an\nexample of applying a temporal dimension to activities for which payback may take some time.)\nAnother economic perspective that applies to space exploration is that it is a public good. No one stakeholder\nwill directly benefit enough to make investments in exploration activities, so it is the role of government to address\nthe market failure by investing directly and allowing the benefits to flow to stakeholders in accordance with their\nrespective priorities. This approach is helpful when the support for an activity is diffuse and the risk/reward profile\nis sufficiently obscure so as to prevent market-based funding mechanisms, as is the case with space exploration. An\nimportant consideration for governments investing in public goods is the likelihood that there will be an eventual\npayoff from the investment.\nAbsent existing theory or practice on determining multi-stakeholder utility in large-scale value delivery systems,\nwe used multiple criteria to assess how the stakeholders we identified would value or prioritize the overarching\nexploration objectives. We used teams of 2 researchers who were well-versed in the priorities and objectives of a\nparticular stakeholder to estimate their affinity to a particular objective by answering the following questions:\nImpact: \"How much will the benefit delivered by exploration align with the stakeholder's values?\". Return: What\nkind of benefit impact is this stakeholder able to deliver back to exploration activities if this objective is met? Lag:\nWhat is the time frame in which the stakeholder will be able to deliver benefit back to exploration activities if this\nobjective is met? Ease: How easy is it to satisfy these objectives through an exploration program focused on the\nmoon and Mars? We used a simple ordinal scale where the score was 0, 1, 3 or 9 for a no, minor, intermediate or\nstrong relation, respectively, between the stakeholder and overarching objective (negative values were used to\nindicate a negative relationship.) This scale and approach to scoring is fairly widely used in a variety of direct\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nassessment methods. The resulting 4 stakeholder by exploration objectives matrices (1 for each question answered)\nwere used as potential input to the preference ordering process.\nThe preference weight for an objective based on exchanges between stakeholders is simply the product of all 4\ncriteria (Impact, Return, Lag, Ease), based on how much the stakeholder values meeting the objective, is willing to\npay for it, the time over which that return will occur, and the ease of providing the benefit to that stakeholder. A\npublic good-based weighting factor is simply the product of the Impact and Ease scores (because there is no\nexpectation of reciprocity in that approach.) A simple average of all stakeholders' scores for a given overarching\nexploration objective provides an overall weight or preference for meeting that objective in the exploration value\ndelivery system.\nIn reality, we know that not all stakeholders are equal. Some are direct participants and some are indirect\nparticipants in the value delivery process. Some of the stakeholders receive value from exploration activities\nthrough intermediaries such as the news media or educators. A simple average is not an accurate way to calculate\npreferences for meeting objectives. The structure of the value delivery system and the relationships between\ndifferent stakeholders play a critical role in determining overall priorities. This requires insight into the value stream\nof the exploration enterprise. Without an understanding of the relationships between stakeholders, an exchange-\nbased approach to calculating preferences lacks adequate information to be accurate. Consequently, as an interim\nsolution we used the measure of correlation between a stakeholder's values and the objective (Impact) to calculate\npreference weightings.\nThe matrix that results from this process presents a map of stakeholders' preferences for seeing different\nobjectives accomplished. While this matrix includes all the information that links stakeholders with objectives, the\nsocietal interest categories are more helpful to architecture decision makers because they present fewer categories of\ninformation for consideration. In light of the discussion above on the impossibility of creating global preference\norders without arbitrary intervention, this approach is preferable to creating one single weight for each objective.\nThe preference weighting for each overarching exploration objective in each societal interest category is simply the\naverage of the scores of all stakeholders within that category. This grouping resulted in a compact matrix, where\neach societal interest category has expressed preference rankings for the overarching exploration objectives. This\nallows decision makers to evaluate different competing architectures through complementary quasi-orthogonal\ndimensions. The resulting matrix is shown in Appendix B.\nIn summary, this approach provides results, but is not entirely satisfactory. We consider it a first approximation\nto a generalized ranking assessment methodology we are currently developing. Our approach to addressing the\nchallenges mentioned is to employ as much information about the system, its stakeholders, and their relationships as\npossible to minimize or eliminate erroneous assumptions. Lean analysis tools such as enterprise value stream\nmapping and analysis tools27, 28, 29 will likely contribute significantly to this. Ultimately, a new method based on this\napproach may allow more information about the system to be preserved for decision makers and architects.\nV. Application of Stakeholder Value to Exploration System Definition\nThe weighted overarching exploration objectives represent exploration priorities--information that can be\nused in the development of the system technical architecture, the architecture of the enterprise that operates it, and\nthe policy environment in which they exist. To recap, weighted objectives contain at least two different kinds of\ninformation. First, the objectives in aggregate reflect the collective interests of the societal stakeholders who might\ndirectly or indirectly benefit from space exploration. In the interest of completeness, the system architect would\nwant to be informed of all exploration objectives to assure that the eventual architecture leaves none unaddressed.\nSecond, the weightings provide a relative prioritization for meeting those objectives, and can be used to inform the\ntradeoffs that are inherent in the architecting process. Additionally, our approach places exploration objectives in\nthe context of the larger value delivery system. Their relative position is reflected by their weighting, but an overall\nunderstanding of the value delivery process provides additional insight into how best to meet those objectives.\nWe've discussed three primary value delivery mechanisms: technical architecture, enterprise architecture, and\npolicy.\nClearly, the technical architecture is the primary mechanism of the three for delivering mass to a planetary\nsurface. The relative weighting of scientific, exploration, and other objectives will determine how payload mass is\ntraded with other priorities. For delivering scientific knowledge from exploration, for instance, the value delivery\nmechanism is less clear-cut. Certainly, a communications and information system and associated infrastructure is\nneeded to return data from remote exploration sites. However, the stakeholder perspective and value delivery\nsystem approach outlined so far also suggest that to deliver exploration information to stakeholders will likely\nrequire an enterprise design that includes processes, rules, and perhaps integration of stakeholders nominally\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nRecon and survey\nSpatial area of a given site that can be reached\nDiversity of sites\nAbility to temporally re -plan within mission\n(week to month)\nAbility to temporally re -plan and adapt in\ncampaign\nExploration payload delivered to M surface\nObservation days for crew on surface\nObservation days for robots on surface\nQuality of\nData\nAmount of\ndata\nTo increase\nknowledge\nabout the\nsolar system\nTO Increase\nKnowledge\ngained from\nexploration\nBY\nconducting\nexperiments\nScientific\nExploration\nExplorers\nScientists\nIndicator Metric\nProximate\nMeasure\nAggregated\nObjective\nObjective\nNeed\nStake\nholder\nexternal to the immediate exploration organization. Understanding what information will provide the most value to\nstakeholders may include political considerations that involve some elements of policy. This holistic approach\nrequires different ways of addressing how to design the exploration system so it will best meet its objectives. The\nfollowing three sections provide an overview of approaches we are using to develop a holistic exploration value\ndelivery system. The first discusses the development of the technical architecture. The second addressed the design\nof an exploration enterprise architecture, while the third addresses policy.\nA. Technical System Architecture\nFrom our perspective, the technical system architecture comprises a transportation system architecture, an\ninformation system architecture and a surface operations architecture. All of these elements of the architecture have\nhistorical precedents. Consequently, the technical systems architecting and analysis for space exploration is the\nmost mature of the\nthree approaches\nwe are addressing\nfor\nachieving\nsustainability.\nIt\ngenerally\nhas\nwell-developed\nmodels, analytical\nt o o l s ,\na n d\nhistorical\ndata\navailable\nwith\nStake\nNeed\nObjective\nAggregated\nProximate\nIndicator Metric\nholder\nObjective\nMeasure\nExplorers\nScientists\nScientific\nExploration\nTO Increase\nKnowledge\ngained from\nexploration\nBY\nconducting\nTo increase\nknowledge\nabout the\nsolar system\nQuality of\nData\nRecon and survey\nSpatial area of a given site that can be reached\nDiversity of sites\nAbility to temporally re -plan within mission\n(week to month)\nAbility to temporally re -plan and adapt in\ncampaign\nexperiments\nAmount of\nExploration payload delivered to M surface\ndata\nObservation days for crew on surface\nObservation days for robots on surface\nwhich to conduct Table 3: Illustration of technical architecture proximate metrics and indicator measure\nanalyses.\nThis generated.\nsection\nbriefly\ndescribes the approach and tools we are using to integrate stakeholder value-based objectives with technical\nevaluation tools and processes.\nA primary challenge in using a stakeholder value-based approach as input to technical system architecting is that\nmetrics of societal value are at a significantly different level of analysis than those necessary for effective system\narchitecting and engineering design. What is valued varies from beneficiary to beneficiary and is hard to measure,\nwith knowledge of values often gained through revealed preferences, which are only evident once an activity such as\na mission is completed. Value can be characterized by indicative metrics, but these too may be dependent upon\nmission completion. The ranking of candidate system architectures takes place long before many stakeholders are\neven aware of a mission, let alone a technical system architecture. Consequently, architecture evaluation metrics\nthat define a trajectory towards the outcome\nWeighted overarching\nthat will ultimately be valued by enterprise\nProximate measure weights\nexploration objectives\nstakeholders must be identified and used.\nWe developed proximate measures as a\nIndicator metric weights\nbridge between stakeholder needs and the\narchitect's needs.

Within architecture analysis.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nStakeHolders/Sustainability\nMars: 60 vs 635 Surface Day Missions\neach of these 8 categories, the proximate measures were assigned a weighting factor to reflect their relative\nimportance in meeting stakeholder objectives++++. Consistent with not creating a global preference ranking, there was\nno attempt to rank or assign weights across the 8 categories. Each of the 61 indicator metrics were also assigned\nweighting factors corresponding to their respective proximate measures. The overall weighting factor for an\nindicator is obtained by multiplying the corresponding metric weight and the indicator weight. Considering the\nproximate measures weights are derived from objectives weights, these indicators, and their weighting factors\nultimately trace their heritage back to the stakeholder value analysis, as shown in Figure 4.\nThe process for evaluating and ranking technical system architectures, also shown in Figure 4, is relatively\nstraightforward. The Object Process Network (OPN) model30, an automated form of OPM, generates the set of\nfeasible architecture variants that satisfy the needs identified using OPM. The number of architecture variants could\nrange in the hundreds or thousands, depending on the parameters of the OPM. For each of these models, a design\nvector is defined, which designates what elements that architecture will comprise as well as their parameters.\nModels of those architecture elements generate values of metrics that correspond to those architecture parameters.\nThis may be done using physics-based models, parametric models, look-up tables based on historical data, etc. Each\narchitecture generated by OPN therefore yields a set of corresponding indicator metrics. The indicator metrics and\ntheir corresponding weighting factors are used to create a proximate measure value for that particular architecture.\nThe sum of proximate measure values within a category creates the architecture score within that category. For each\ncategory, there is a benchmark value defined by a given mission profile. The scores in all categories generated for\neach architecture are normalized against those benchmark values to aid in comparison. The normalized scores are\ndepicted in a bar chart like the one shown in Figure 5\nFigure 5 compares two architectures for\nMars exploration, one that considers a 60 day\nstay on Mars surface (left) and another one that\nconsiders a 635 day stay (right). The categories\nEXP (exploration value), SCI (science value),\n1.2\nCOM (commercial value), SEC (security\nvalue), PUB (public value), AFF (affordability),\n0.8\nPOL (policy robustness) and RIS (risk &\nsafety) are presented separately to show readily\n0.6\nwhere the relative strengths and weaknesses of\nan architecture lie, as well as to aid\n0.4\ninterpretation of the outcome.

The scores generated are not absolute values, but\nordinal ranked values. Consequently, an architect can determine which of a number of candidate architectures is\n++++ The technical architecture analysis portion of this study proceeded concurrently with the stakeholder value\nanalysis. Because of differing rates of progress in the respective areas of research (more mature areas such as\ntechnical architecting proceeded more rapidly than less the mature area of stakeholder analysis), estimated values\nwere used to weight the proximate measures. Preliminary proximate measures weights were used to create those\nestimates and were generated by the stakeholder value analysis using the following process. The extent to which the\nproximate measures were an indicator of progress on the exploration objectives was estimated using the same\nprocess outlined in Section IV. A team of researchers individually assessed the relationship between exploration\nobjectives and the proximate measures, and then collectively reviewed the ratings to create a matrix with\nExploration Objectives arrayed by Proximate Measures. The rating scale was the same 0, 1, 3, 9 scale as described\npreviously, with negative values indicating an opposite correlation. Weighted exploration objectives by societal\ninterest category were created as described in Section IV (and are found in Appendix B.) The multiplication of the\nweighted exploration objectives by the matrix just described produces weighted proximate measures. In future\nspirals of this project, the weighting factors will be developed directly from the stakeholder value analysis.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nbetter than the others, but not necessarily by how much. This is useful for filtering through a large architecture trade\nspace to identify the most promising candidates. Once that has been done, more detailed and rigorous analysis must\nbegin to predict more accurately the expected performance of architecture candidates. This initial step is valuable\nbecause it helps avoid locally-optimized designs that may perform poorly in a global or extended time-frame\ncontext.. This discussion also illustrates how the values of societal stakeholders, seemingly diffuse, can be used to\nguide analysis and outcomes of a technical system architecture.\nB. Enterprise Architecture\nThe architecture of the exploration enterprise will play an enormous role in enabling the sustainability of the\nexploration effort. It will fall on the exploration enterprise to define,\nevolve and operate the exploration elements and to continuously deliver\nWeighted overarching\nvalue to the stakeholders. This includes defined roles and responsibilities\nfor each stakeholder to ensure that overarching exploration objectives are\nIdentify exploration objectives\nexploration objectives\npursued, that the exploration campaign strategy is executable, and that\nfor enterprise solution\ncritical technologies are available when needed to enable the evolution and\nexpansion of the exploration technical system of systems (SoS.)

Flow of stakeholder-based\nIn approach, our process for defining the enterprise architecture is very metrics into enterprise architecture\nsimilar to that for defining the technical architecture. The principle steps analysis.\nare shown in Figure 6. Many exploration objectives (and components of\nsustainability) can be addressed by multiple approaches, so a first step for enterprise architecting is to identify\nobjectives that will be met primarily (or influenced heavily) through enterprise design and/or operations.\nOverarching exploration objectives are ranked by whether they can be best accomplished using approaches\nprincipally involving enterprise architecture, policy, hardware, or information systems. The subset of objectives\nidentified as best achievable by enterprise architecture became the starting point for an iterative decomposition\nexercise aimed at linking objectives to specific enterprise attributes and, ultimately, functions.\nWhile still early in the development of this approach, we are already seeing the potential to develop a clearly\ndefined set of enterprise level principles, functions and processes based on stakeholder needs and exploration\nobjectives. With these principles, functions and processes defined, existing research and literature on general\nmanagement, lean enterprises, and other organizing concepts will provide the material to develop actionable plans,\npolicies and organizational forms and relationships.\nC. Policy Development\nA robust policy structure is a primary component of space exploration sustainability. The exploration\nstakeholders most closely associated with policy--the Executive and Legislative branches of the US\ngovernment--are direct stakeholders that control vital fiscal resources, as well as craft the legislation and directives\nthat define the rules of engagement between the exploration enterprise and the other exploration stakeholders.\nInternational partners, while indirect stakeholders to the US space exploration program, also provide critical\nenabling funding, technology, and personnel. The policy stakeholders are principally government entities, and as\nsuch, are also intermediaries between the exploration enterprise and other exploration stakeholders. This means that\nthey simultaneously provide guidance, vision, and enabling resources, but also rely on the support and feedback of\nother constituent stakeholders as a signal that those stakeholders value the benefits that space exploration activities\ngenerate. Policy stakeholders are a key part of the exploration value stream and value delivery system, enable value\ndelivery by directing activities that benefit other stakeholders, and ensure through oversight that correct technical,\noperational, and strategic objectives are pursued to enable that value delivery. Because of these interdependencies,\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nit is important that policy development for sustainable space exploration be an integral part of the development of\nthe technical and enterprise exploration systems.\nThe formal approach we are using for policy development as part of this study is to develop functional models of\nthe executive and legislative policy-making and policy-executing processes. This is done by identifying and\nanalyzing relevant legislation, appropriations and authorization language, and executive policy documents, currently\nfor the period from 1995 through 2004. Historical policy documents are also used to provide background\ninformation. Content analysis is being used to construct categories of policy action, as well as identify areas of\nuncertainty or risk for the exploration system. These categories and underlying data will enable the quantification of\npositive or negative returns from specific courses of action in space exploration, including technical, mission, or\nenterprise architecture choices. Once the development of the policy process models is complete, they will be cross-\nreferenced to the overarching exploration objectives, technical system of system architecture, and enterprise\narchitecture study activities. For instance, one of the assessment metric areas for technical architecture tradeoffs is\npolicy. Completed policy models will allow, for instance, the direct comparison of specific technical architectures\non the basis of their policy robustness (current models rely on heuristics and estimates as placeholders.) This work\nis currently underway.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis paper presents the first stages in development of a process that is aimed at clearly defining and then\narchitecting a socio-technical system (enterprise and technical system architecture) for a unique public sector\nactivity. Its ultimate goal is to identify sustainable approaches for space exploration. Because of its sustainability\nfocus, the scope of this study has expanded to include not only the technical architecture, but also the general\ndelivery of value to all stakeholders in the space exploration system. This includes considerations of the stakeholder\ncommunity, its needs and resulting objectives for space exploration, and how those objectives determine choices\nmade for the design of the technical system of systems architecture, the exploration enterprise architecture, and\nsupporting policy environment. Through this work we are integrating a number of existing tools and processes, and\nalso developing new analysis tools and processes, for instance for enterprise analysis and architecting. As part of an\nongoing effort, we expect that changes to the methodology and method will be made as experience and knowledge is\ngained with it. To date, many parts of the analysis have been done with graduate students; for actual application of\nthe method, practicing experts (if not stakeholders and/or their representatives) should at minimum be involved in\nthe development of stakeholder needs and exploration objectives.\nThe unique approach to this study is generating a number of new and important contributions. First, it elevates\nsustainability as a primary consideration during exploration system architecting and design. More traditional system\narchitecting would likely focus primarily on achieving the very challenging technical objectives. The 4 components\nof sustainability bring focus on delivering value to exploration stakeholders over the lifecycle of the endeavor,\naddressing risk and affordability not only through the technical system, but also through the exploration enterprise,\nand the policy environment. These additional objectives are forcing the development of new analytical techniques\nand processes to enable system architecting, systems engineering, and enterprise design and management. We\nbelieve these tools and insights will benefit system architects not only for space exploration, but in other complex\nengineering systems, by providing a more comprehensive set of information with which to make system design and\nmanagement decisions.\nDespite the promise of these new techniques and tools, this is an early report of efforts. There is considerable\nwork yet to do. Areas that show promise, and deserve additional attention include development of multi-stakeholder\nutility models and theory to enable complex system architecture tradeoffs and optimization; more fully-developed\nmethods for transforming stakeholder objectives to enterprise functions, including specific design and\nimplementation guidelines; and the development of an integrated process for linking policy-making with technical\nsystem and enterprise design. These are all areas in which our team is currently working and hope to produce\nprogress updates soon.\nAppendix A\nOverarching Exploration Objectives (order does not imply priority):\n1.\nTo increase knowledge about the evolution of the solar system\n2.\nTo pursue sustained exploration by locating and exploring in situ resources\n3.\nTo prepare for the exploration of the next destination by increasing operations, resources and\ninfrastructure knowledge\n4.\nTo increase crew safety, ensure crew physical health and increase crew comfort\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n5.\nTo increase and maintain high public interest and awareness\n6.\nTo increase and maintain high workforce motivation\n7.\nTo promote youth interest for science and engineering\n8.\nTo increase and maintain high support to NASA\n9.\nTo interact with explorers\n10.

Stagney\nChapter 4:\nICE - In Practice, An Organizational Quagmire\nThe previous chapter detailed the theoretical advantages that the MATE-CON process\nhas over other popular forms of Concurrent Engineering. But if it is a superior\napproach to the design of complex systems, why hasn't it become more widely\nadopted? Is there an inherent conflict between the paradigm of decomposition (that is\nthe basis for most modern organizational structures), and the philosophies that power\nIntegrated Concurrent Engineering and MATE-CON? In order to answer these\nquestions, the implementation of these processes in a real organization must be studied\nin depth.\nSection 4-A:\nRecent ICE Implementations\nSeveral major organizations have implemented Integrated Concurrent Engineering\n(ICE) processes in the last 5 years. Their uses range from designing small satellite\npayloads to large \"system-of-systems\" communication architectures. While each of\nthese design facilities have been highly successful in achieving their Technical\nobjectives, they each dealt with difficult People and Process issues (Heim et al, 1999),\n(Parkin, et al, 2003), (Sanders, 2002), (Wall et al, 1999), (Neff and Presley, 2000).\nBefore presenting the detailed case study, the following general lessons can be learned:\nx All teams found that a dedicated, \"standing\" design team was the most powerful\napproach. True process improvement requires a team to practice a process\nmany times and then to have the authority and accountability to make positive\nchanges.\nx The physical layout of the design \"home room\" was just as important to the\nteam's success as the information-exchange architecture. Communication\nhappened verbally, non-verbally and electronically.\nx Strong, passionate leadership was essential.\nx The highest-performing team members were those who were able to be flexible\nand look at the whole system rather than reverting to being subsystem experts\nonly.\nx All the teams started with a self-described \"crude\" information exchange\nprocess. They improvised and innovated as they progressed rather than waiting\nfor a large, complicated new software system that was everything to everyone.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 62 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B.

In rapid succession, the new RTCE\nteam built customized design tools, validated their technical performance and began\ngenerating high quality proposals.\nAn outside expert initially facilitated the efforts of the RTCE team. The courageous\nmanager who sponsored the project obtained internal development funds based on\nanticipated efficiency gains in his new product design department. His staff consisted\nof approximately 75 engineers who were each assigned in a matrix fashion from their\nfunctional group on a rotational basis. Although all of these specialists were co-located\nin the product design department, each retained accountability to their home\ndepartment, and reported to their functional managers for performance evaluations.\nThis department was essentially a product-development IPT.\nThe team began by meeting together to identify the entire set of information that would\nbe exchanged during a design session. This exercise began with each subsystem\nrepresentative listing a very specific set of variables that were required to design a\nstandard product. Other subsystem representatives then signed up to provide the data\nfor each variable during the session. The result was a massive table with several\nthousand pieces of information that, in the past had all been exchanged manually.\nImmediately, the team became energized - they realized that they would never again\nwant or have to design products using their old process.\nAfter the needs-identification was complete, each subsystem designer was then tasked\nwith creating a design tool that could translate the requested inputs into the outputs\nnecessary to create a preliminary design. This process took approximately three\nmonths.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 63 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nRealizing that the new way of\nworking together would encounter\nresistance from many different\nparts of the organization, the\nsponsoring manager put together a\ncomprehensive implementation\nplan and budget. He met with\nsome senior leaders in the\ncompany and passionately\nobtained their buy-in for the first\nFigure 4-B-1: Photo of the Real-Time\nstages of development. He then\nConcurrent Engineering Team at work in\ntheir Home Room\nchallenged his best employees to\nhelp him make the concept into a reality. His personal dedication to the new process\nsent a clear signal to all involved that the RTCE project had absolute support.\nThe next phase of the implementation involved a technical validation of the new design\nmethod. The team leader announced a series of weekly meetings in which the new\nsystem would be used to design a product that the team had designed manually in the\npast two years. This approach proved to be extremely effective on a number of\ndifferent levels.\nBy beginning with very simple designs, the team could get a 'first-draft' of their new\ntools up and running very quickly. Instead of working for months to develop complex\nmodels that could be used for every possible design scenario, team members were\nquickly able to understand what worked and what didn't. Additionally, the element of\n'peer pressure' was introduced to the team - if one team member showed up\nunprepared for a validation meeting, he or she knew that they would be holding up the\nentire team. But, by practicing on designs that were familiar to all of the team\nmembers, the anxiety of working together in a new process was reduced significantly -\nthe team avoided technical uncertainties and could thus take their time and focus on the\ngroup process and their new system-level perspective. Finally, as the team worked\nthrough the validation process, their confidence and excitement grew steadily - they\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 64 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nwere fully energized and more than well prepared by the time they used the new RTCE\nprocess on their first real design challenge.\nSince the RTCE team was able to focus its work life around a very specific set of tasks,\nthey were able to refine their process over time. The team is currently capable of\nproducing a new product proposal in approximately 30 days (compared to 45 days or\nmore using the traditional approach). Within this time frame, the RTCE team is also\nnow able to compare and contrast approximately 7200 different design parameters\nbetween each of ten or more preliminary technical designs in order to arrive at a final\ndesign. Using their previous method, they traded 10 to 20 performance characteristics\nof two or three preliminary ideas before moving on to analyze their final design in\ndetail.\nSection 4-C:\nDeep Dive: Current and Emerging Benefits of RTCE\nBetween June of 2002 and July of 2003, the author performed a number of surveys of\nkey team members and an extensive set of interviews of team leaders and company\nmanagers - including the company President, Chief Technology Officer and three Vice\nPresidents. In addition, more than ten full-length concurrent design sessions and\nnumerous leadership meetings were witnessed first hand in order to gather\nobservational data on the performance of the RTCE team.\nAn analysis of these data reveals that the RTCE process has dramatically improved the\nnew product design process at the company. It creates value by increasing the Quality\nof the company's designs and manufactured products, the Speed at which they are\ncreated, by fostering product and process Innovation, and enhancing Learning\nopportunities.\nNOTE: The following findings were based on anecdotal evidence gathered by\ninterview, survey and observation. Refer to Section E of this chapter for quantitative\nperformance metrics.\nQUALITY: For each new product proposal, more design options are examined, and\neach is evaluated far more rigorously. On average, the team examines at least three\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 65 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\npotential design configurations using the new process. Each conceptual design consists\nof up to 7,000 standard design variables, which are input, calculated or otherwise\ndetermined. Each of these variables is stored in a database, and, because they are\ncommon to all designs, competing architectures can be compared directly to one\nanother.\nEach designer has continuous access to latest published design variables and\nassumptions. In the past, weekly design coordination meetings were held to update the\nteam members on important design parameters. In between these meetings, subsystem\ndesigners often communicated informally to trade information via e-mail or hallway\nconversations. Using this ad-hoc information-exchange architecture, however, it was\nnot uncommon for team members to learn that the past week's worth of work had to be\ncompletely re-done because of a change made to another subsystem that they were\nunaware of.\nIn the new RTCE process, the team discusses details in real-time that could otherwise\nbe overlooked or forgotten. During the course of the validation program and as new\ndesigns began to be completed, the team began to notice that there were a substantial\nnumber of items that were systematically addressed during each RTCE session that\nwere often neglected in the previous, decomposed design method. They realized that\nthe thoroughness to which each product proposal had previously been completed varied\nwidely depending on the proposal manager and the particular budget or schedule for\nthat project. The team was pleased to set a new and consistent standard of excellence\nin all of their deliverables.\nKey suppliers and manufacturing personnel could be more easily included in the\nearliest stages of the design. Although the RTCE team has not yet tapped into the huge\nreservoir of potential design improvements that could be realized by pulling\ndownstream suppliers into the conceptual design process, the modular structure of the\nRTCE process could easily accommodate their inclusion. Further gains will be made\nby the elimination of the hard hand-off that occurs between the new product design\nprocess and the initiation of the detailed design work done in other departments.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 66 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nCurrently, the detailed design engineers take the proposal generated by the RTCE team\nas proof that the product can be built, but start the design process from scratch because\nit is not in a format they can easily build upon and because they do not necessarily trust\nthe output of the proposal team. This disconnect can account for up to 10% of the\ndevelopment time for each new product.\nSPEED: In the world of competitive bidding, the reduced lead times for each proposal\ncreated by the RTCE process can become a strong competitive advantage. Often, the\nRTCE team is generating proposals for potential customers that have not completely\nfrozen all of their design criteria. The ability to rapidly incorporate last-minute changes\nor ideas (without heroic over-time) increases customer satisfaction and allows the team\nto be the first to set a customer's expectations. As the company negotiates final\ncontracts, the RTCE process has become a competitive advantage - the speed with\nwhich the team can incorporate the latest revisions into their proposed design gives the\nnegotiating team more detailed information to share with the customer and more\nconfidence that the proposed design can be turned into real hardware with the time and\nbudget they base their final offer on. And during the negotiations, the fact that the\ncompany can now help a new customer rapidly work through a number of \"what-if\"\nscenarios as they develop their business plan leads to strategic advantages as well - the\ncompany is in a better position to match the needs of their customers with the standard\ndesigns that also fit their long-term corporate objectives.\nShorter programs are less expensive. The same number of people working on a team\nfor less time simply saves the company money.\nRTCE designs mature more quickly resulting in a program with less uncertainty and\nrework. Since the team is able to quickly converge upon a conceptual design that\nconsists of up to 7,000 standard design variables, the risk of finding a major flaw in a\nproposed design is nearly eliminated. As mentioned above, using the previous method,\nthe team often went a week without exchanging vital information. If these meetings\nwere not highly organized, a design that was nearly complete could have to be\ncompletely redone because it was based upon false assumptions or incorrect data.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 67 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nINNOVATION: In its ideal state, the RTCE process focuses on system optimization\nbased on customer value - rather than sub-system optimization based on rigid\nspecifications. The RTCE team has worked hard to develop and validate their\nworksheet models based on their desire to run smooth, efficient design sessions. In\naddition, the company has placed its future in the hands of a small number of standard\nproduct platforms in order to reduce manufacturing lead-time and cost.\nThese objectives compete, however, with the process' power to spark innovation based\non the system-level visibility afforded to each of the team members. During a session\nthat can include up to 25 participants, it is difficult for one or two designers to take the\ntime to try out a new idea. If an entirely new class of products were to be designed, the\ncurrent RTCE process would have to be started over from the beginning in order to\ncreate a truly innovative new product architecture. Due to the highly complex technical\nchallenges involved, these efforts would have to be supported by a traditional R&D\norganization, however the work of that group can now be much more closely aligned\nwith the needs of the company and its customers.\nSub-system specialists who may never have worked together have the opportunity to\nshare ideas and seek out new solutions to historical problems - classic organizational\nbarriers are broken. During idle time, the most effective team members will seek out\ntheir peers and attempt to work together to constantly improve upon the performance of\nthe system. Many of them finally have the opportunity to see how other subsystems are\ndesigned, and to understand the underlying reasons for certain design or interface\nrequirements. In many cases, team members found that requirements that were\nextremely costly or difficult for them to implement were simply passed down from\nprevious product generations - through the Integrated Concurrent Engineering Process,\nthey were able to ask the right questions of the right people and replace those highly\nwasteful legacies with innovative new solutions.\nParticipants take ownership in their process as well as their product. Over time, and\nwith practice, the RTCE team has become highly proficient. They know the\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 68 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\ncapabilities of their system and each other. They are proud to represent their individual\nfunctional groups, and have proposed numerous improvements to their process.\nLEARNING: The system-level perspective provided by RTCE yields a tremendous\nviewpoint for each engineer and business staffer to understand the impacts of their\ndecisions and work. Whereas each subsystem specialist used to only concern\nthemselves with the performance of their particular section of the design and would\nwork in isolation from each other, the team members now sit and work together. In\naddition, the top-level performance metrics are constantly displayed - team members\nhave instant feedback as to the impact their design decisions have on the performance\nof the overall system.\nDynamic models allow each new team member to \"try-out\" numerous what-if\nscenarios quickly and realistically. Due to the parametric nature of the models that the\nteam built, new ideas can be evaluated easily and objectively rather than being shunned\nby managers who in the past did not have the time or resources to examine them. This\nnew capability has a tremendous impact on the depth of knowledge that team members\npossess. They now have the opportunity to gain a more intuitive understanding of the\nsystem and the interactions of their particular subsystem as well, rather than being\nanalysts who simply run the same set of equations over and over without ever really\nunderstanding the alternatives or underlying behavior of the system.\nNew ideas are evaluated objectively rather than subjectively (opinions based on status\nor perceived cost). In the past, many ideas put forth by new engineers were also\nrejected because higher-level engineers or managers already had a mental picture of\nwhat the final system would look like. This \"design-by-seniority\" approach tended to\nproduce products that were all very similar to each other and that always contained the\nsame set of subsystems no matter what. Although this conservative method produced\nproducts that were highly reliable and predictable, it discouraged the brightest and most\ninnovative engineers - they tended to get discouraged and sought out more innovative\njobs. This not only hurt the company in the short term, but also could have the effect of\ncreating a vacuum of talent that could be particularly damaging when the current group\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 69 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nof senior engineers retires in the next few years. The introduction of the RTCE process\nhelps younger engineers raise their voice and show the validity of their ideas in an\nobjective forum. This ability encourages them to continue to introduce new ideas and\nto be recognized for them.\nSection 4-D:\nDeep Dive: Problems with RTCE\nUnfortunately, by the winter of 2002 / 2003, circumstances surrounding the RTCE\nteam were beginning to threaten its performance gains. At the same time the\ncompany developed the RTCE project's capabilities, the company's key markets\nbegan to sink - customers were delaying orders already in progress and withdrawing\nfrom talk of any new contracts. This created tremendous pressure on the RTCE team\nfrom all sides. The company experienced a net loss and was forced to lay off nearly\n50% of its work force.\nBesides the obvious emotional impacts, these circumstances masked the efficiency\ngains that the RTCE team had fought so hard to win - since people had less total work\nto do, were uncertain about their future employment prospects and genuinely wanted to\nhelp the company win more new business, they spent more time on each individual\nproject than was necessary. By simply measuring the total cost of each new design, the\nmanagers were unable to see the improvements made by the team in the efficiency of\ntheir conceptual design process. Figure 4-D-1 shows that when the total length of the\nnew product design process was held the same, the savings created by a more efficient\npreliminary design process were offset by other work. Thus the ROI metric commonly\nused as a measure to determine if the RTCE team should receive more funding did not\nreflect favorably on the work of the team.\nAside from these market-related problems, the RTCE team's rapid ascension created\nsome unique and particularly challenging organizational and political problems within\nthe company. These issues must be addressed in order for the team to achieve its\nultimate goals, but are also of particular interest to other teams that may be planning to\nimplement a similar real-time concurrent engineering process.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 70 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 71 of 180\nOrganizational Structure: Figure 4-D-2 shows the current structure of the RTCE\nteam's company. The manager of the Product Development group initiated the RTCE\nproject, which is a part of the Systems Engineering Division. This was a logical place\nto implement ICE techniques - this department performed nearly 40 new product\nproposals each year, so there were tremendous opportunities for process improvement.\nBy June of 2002, all new product proposals were run through the RTCE team and its\nprocess. As the impact of their work began to reach other parts of the company\nhowever, the team began to encounter some resistance. For example, the marketing\ngroup was directly in touch with major customers but was not heavily involved in the\ndevelopment of the RTCE process. Although the RTCE team received detailed product\nspecifications, they often had questions or needed market guidance during their\nconcurrent design sessions. The marketing managers that participated actively in these\nsessions helped the RTCE team produce superb results. Alternately, some market\nProject\nInitiatio\nn.\nReview\nSpec.\n(~10%)\nCreate\nPreliminary\nDesign.\n(~40%)\nDetermine\naccurate\ncost and\nlead time\n(~33%)\nWrite\nProduct\nProposal.\n(~17%)\nSTART (Process Prior to ICE)\nEND\nEND\nProject\nInitiatio\nn.\nReview\nSpec.\n(~10%)\nCreate\nPreliminary\nDesign.\n(~12%)\nDetermine\naccurate\ncost and\nlead time\n(~33%)\nWrite\nProduct\nProposal.\n(~17%)\nAnalyze\nPreliminary\nDesign,\nPropose\nAlternatives.\n(~26%)\nSTART (Process with ICE)\nFigure 4-D-1: Timeline of the RTCE Team's typical project prior to and after the\nimplementation of ICE techniques.

This was the result of a scoping decision early on in the\nRTCE project (the effectiveness of the team began to trail off as the number of\nparticipants in a design session grew past about 15 people), but began to negatively\nimpact the company's new product offerings because their input came too late to have\ndramatic impacts on cost or lead time. Figure 4-D-3 illustrates the effects of the barrier\nbetween the RTCE team (who performed the Preliminary Design tasks shown in the\nbottom third of the diagram) and the Operations group (who performed the Detailed\nDesign and Manufacturing and Test tasks shown in the middle and top thirds). Note\nthat there were other barriers within the operations group as well.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 72 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B.

Systemic barriers can create large amounts of rework and lengthen the\nschedule because the information produced in one phase is often not in the form that can\nbe easily used by the next, or work is redone because of mistrust or miscommunication.\nOne of the long-standing goals of the RTCE team was to implement a \"grass-roots\"\ncost model that would allow them to accurately weigh competing design options in real\ntime. In the meantime, the team employed a cost estimation model based on historical\ndata that was adjusted by the team members' estimates of relative complexity. A poll\nof RTCE team members taken in July and August of 2002 revealed that designers had\nan average \"confidence\" in the current cost model of 2.69 (on a scale of 1 to 5). To\ncompensate for this, each proposed design was submitted to the operations group for a\ndetailed cost estimate - an effort that took nearly two weeks and was very expensive.\nAs mentioned previously, RTCE team members still reported to their functional\nmanagers for administrative and evaluation purposes. When the sponsoring manager's\noverhead budget and the R&D funds began to dwindle, each team member was asked\nto continue working on their home department's portion of the RTCE project using the\noverhead accounts of their functional managers. Although several of the team\nmembers felt very strongly about the continued success of the project and lobbied their\nmanagers successfully, many functional managers were unwilling to support what they\nperceived as another manager's pet project with their own limited funds. The\nsponsoring manager responded by inviting the functional managers to participate in a\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 73 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nRTCE design session so they could see first hand the value of the new process - only a\nsmall percentage accepted the offer.\nSenior Leaders within the company were aware of the organizational issues that were\naffecting the continued success of the RTCE team, but disagreed about how to proceed.\nThey clearly saw the need to break down barriers between the different divisions but\nfelt that other initiatives would have a more immediate effect on the short-term\nprofitability of the company, and thus shifted more resources to those projects than to\nthe RTCE team.\nThe RTCE team was also having difficulty prioritizing the issues they faced because\nthey wanted to convey a positive message at all times. They were afraid that if they\nhighlighted the problems, they could risk losing the support they already had.\nAdditionally, it was hard for them to articulate the value of their process in terms of the\nstrict return on investment (ROI) calculations that senior managers insisted on. The\nRTCE leadership had competing ideas regarding the benefits they had shown and the\njustifications for continued investment.\nOrganizational Culture: The shift to real-time concurrent engineering had a dramatic\nimpact on the roles and responsibilities of each team member involved. RTCE team\nmembers were initially excited and motivated - many stated that they would never be\nable to do their jobs in the traditional manner ever again. There was a general euphoria\nthat surrounded an innovative new way of doing business in the first months of the\nproject. Over time, however, technical challenges, market conditions and\norganizational changes all took their toll on project morale. Interviews with team\nmembers elicited the following:\n\"I felt that I resolved some on-going questions w/ my counterparts. [The RTCE\nprocess] provides a great opportunity for open discussion\"\n\"Received a good look at the design concept - received really good interaction\nfrom [the project manager]\"\n\"Since I had no schedule input, I felt like I wasted 1 to 2 hours of my time\nlistening to schedule discussions\"\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 74 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\n\"People were forced to sign up for previous aggressive schedules w/o time to\nreview justifications\"\nRTCE Team members were also asked to rate the level of participation they felt they\nhad displayed during each concurrent design session (see below). These data revealed\nthat even though RTCE members were doing their work together and sharing\ninformation electronically and in the \"around-the-room\" format, nearly half of them did\nnot behave differently than if they had been working in their own offices.\n17% said, \"Focused only on my client (design spreadsheet)\"\n48% said, \"Talked to one or two other people\"\n26% said, \"Solved a minor problem (group of 1 or 2)\"\n0% said, \"Solved a major problem (group of 3 to 5)\"\n4% said, \"Helped entire group work through an issue\"\n4% said, \"Was involved in a major design decision\nBy the end of the summer of 2002, the growth of the RTCE team passed through many\nphases and was beginning to impact more company stakeholders than originally\nanticipated in the team charter. As its boundaries expanded beyond those directly\ninvolved, certain perceptions - based on the paradigms of the existing organizational\nculture - arose:\nMyth #1: \"RTCE is a great new tool for the company. Once this team is finished\ndeveloping it, we can deploy it to many other divisions to realize similar gains.\"\nFacts: Each individual toolset is highly customized and serves merely to\nenhance the effectiveness of each designer - allowing them the freedom to try\nout new ideas quickly and work together to find innovative solutions to\nunexpected problems. These toolsets evolve over time, and their strength\ncomes from the fact that they are not just \"plug-and-play\" spreadsheets. Real-\ntime concurrent engineering is a process - not a technical tool - that is only as\npowerful as the team running it. To be effective, the team must first learn a new\nway of working together, define their unique design variables, build and\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 75 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nvalidate their client models, then practice, learn and adapt. Any team is capable\nof becoming a high-performing RTCE team, but it will not happen over night.\nMyth #2: \"RTCE is going to save us tons of money because it automates the design\nprocess\"\nFacts: As one practitioner of ICE put it: \"Computers cannot replace people in\nconceptual design. Rather, a good information system supports human\nstrengths and compensates for human weakness.\" (Neff and Presley, 2000) One\nof the company's key strengths throughout its history has been the superb\ndesigns its engineers produce. Although Lean concepts and new processes such\nas ICE can help designers become far more efficient and effective, the need for\ncreative human intuition is actually far more necessary in the new business\nprocess than in the old. Attendance at a real-time concurrent engineering\ndesign session proves instantly that there is nothing automatic about designing a\n100 Million Dollar piece of highly customized technology.\nMyth #3: \"RTCE is dangerous because it creates 'template engineers' who know\nnothing about the complex hardware they are designing.\"\nFacts: Fine balances between knowledge re-use and innovation must be drawn\nand constantly monitored. Although ICE techniques find a great deal of their\nefficiency in the fact that designers can quickly make use of complex analytical\ntools and historical databases that were prepared ahead of time, teams have\nfound that the spreadsheets they go into a session with must be as flexible as\nthey are accurate. If a designer enters a real-time concurrent engineering\nsession thinking that his only job is to man his client, then that person might as\nwell not be there. The most powerful solutions come from discussions between\ndifferent designers regarding a difficult problem, not from a pull-down menu.\nMyth #4: \"RTCE designs cost just as much as traditional designs - there's no payback\nfor the R&D money we invested.\"\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 76 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nFacts: The metrics presented in Section 4-E show that the cost of a new\nproduct design using the RTCE process is about the same as it was using the\nprevious method. However it has become clear that the quality of the work\noutput by the team is substantially higher. Due to the nature of the process,\nteams are able to uncover hidden inconsistencies that otherwise would have not\nbeen addressed until weeks or months later in the detail design process. In one\ninstance, the RTCE team tested this theory by repeating the design effort of a\nproduct they had done using the traditional method. The actual team members\nand the initial specification were the same - the only difference was the design\nprocess employed. The results were dramatic. The RTCE team uncovered a\nnumber of major errors and oversights in their initial design.\nThe increased depth of detail and exploration early on in the design process not only\nleads to a design with lower risk of technical failure, but also eventually means less\nwork and rework for the detail design team. Applying ICE techniques, concurrent\nengineering teams now have the opportunity to examine more design options and\ninspect each one at a higher level of fidelity. The team can then openly and objectively\nselect the best design for the particular customer, and then more easily communicate in\na proposal what was chosen and why.\nLeadership: Just as the senior management struggled to understand the current and\nfuture capabilities of the evolving RTCE team, the team leadership dealt with similar\nissues of vision and scope. This small group was faced with a number of important\ndecisions and forced to prioritize their own limited resources.\nAmong the most pressing matters was the roster of the RTCE team itself. As\nmentioned previously, the original team was composed of the subsystem engineers who\nhad been assigned to the product development center for their technical expertise.\nAlthough they represented the most important subsystems, they did not represent all of\nthe specialized functions that were required to complete a final design. They had\nexcelled in positions that allowed them to represent their own functional groups and to\ncoordinate the design activity within their own groups. In the new team however, these\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 77 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nindividuals were being asked not only to make binding decisions in real time regarding\ntheir subsystems, but also to seek out and correct system-level problems that they had\nnever before been exposed to.\nThe RTCE leadership worked to motivate these team members and to guide the team\nby expressing their expectations through group and individual \"roles and\nresponsibility\" statements. Unfortunately, the political and organizational boundaries\nthat separated the team members from the rest of the engineers and technicians who\nwould be doing the detailed design work after a contract was won, could not be\novercome by motivation alone. The team was aware that in many cases, after a\ncontract was signed, the detailed designers disregarded their work and began the design\nprocess from scratch because they did not understand or trust what was done during the\nconceptual design process.\nBut within the team, were the leaders pushing the members to change too quickly, or\ndid they just need to have a fundamentally different type of person assigned to this new\njob description? One manager suggested that the team should be comprised of younger\nengineers who were more comfortable working with the complex ICEMaker\nspreadsheets that had been designed. This team of \"learners\" would be able to rapidly\nunderstand the system they were working on and quickly iterate to a solution that best\nmet the customer's needs for any particular project. Others argued that the team should\nconsist of more experienced, senior experts. This team of \"knowers\" would be better\nable to come up with designs that would be robust, manufacturable, and built upon the\ncompany's vast history of technical achievements.\nThe leadership also pondered the outside commitments team members had to their\nfunctional managers. How could they expect the team members to think and act with\nsystem optimization as a goal when they were going to be evaluated, given raises or\neven laid off based on the performance evaluation of another manager with a set of\npriorities centered on optimizing their own subsystem? Unfortunately, the leaders of\nthe product design group spent a majority of their time in meetings and did not take the\ntime to discuss these difficult issues individually with the team members. Although the\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 78 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nleaders felt that these were systemic issues that arose from company policy which\ncould not easily be changed, the fact that these issues went un-discussed caused a great\ndeal of anxiety and frustration among team members.\nNext, the RTCE leadership had to decide how to obtain more funding for their program\nand where it could be applied most effectively. There were clear differences of opinion\nin this arena, and the sponsoring manager tried to give the team leaders the autonomy\nto make a decision based on their own vision, however without clear authority given to\none member decisive action was not easily taken. One side advocated strongly to add\nCAD modeling capabilities so that team members could visualize complex assemblies\nand create more complete designs during each session. This effort would involve\nsubcontractors creating libraries of standard parts - an expensive and lengthy\nproposition, but one that could add great strength to the team. Others desired\nimprovements to the cost modeling or additional functionality for each subsystem\nclient. Each option needed to have its cost and return on investment estimated in good\ndetail.\nFinally, the RTCE leadership wanted to measure its progress using metrics. They\nhoped that an analysis of labor hours spent, design completeness or the number of\noptions examined would provide conclusive evidence of their positive impacts on the\ncompany. The initial data were inconclusive, however. It showed that the potential\nvalue RTCE could add to the company could only be realized by increasing the scope\nof the process - beyond preliminary design and into detail design work and\nmanufacturing. The team leadership used these metrics as aids in decision-making\nhowever and did not attempt to set targets so that the RTCE team could monitor its\nachievements on a continuous basis.\nFinancial: The last major category of organizational issues that the RTCE team\nencountered involved money. As mentioned above, internal R&D funding was limited\ndue to the market conditions and the financial position of the company. Although the\nbold move taken by the sponsoring manager to charge initial work to his overhead\naccount had paid for itself handsomely in the form of a fully functional and value-\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 79 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nadding process, more work needed to be done. Some members of the team felt that\nsubstantial expenditures were required to achieve the goals they had laid out. Others\nfelt that a great deal of progress could be made using a \"coordinated-individuals\"\napproach - having people work on process-improvement as they performed value-\nadded work for each new project. Were there contributions that could be made by team\nmembers in their spare time? In the spirit of real-time concurrent engineering,\nwouldn't working team feedback / continuous improvement meetings a much more\neffective approach to the teams near term challenges than a centralized, rigid task list?\nPersonal and organizational incentives also played a large role in the actions of the\nRTCE team. The company operated under a system whereby R&D investments would\nbe repaid over time by decreases in a department's allocated budget based on the\nprojected savings of the projects that received funding. So, if for example, the RTCE\nteam stated in a proposal that an investment of one million dollars would result in a 5%\nproductivity improvement, the product development department would have their\nbudget reduced by 5% the next year. This system was intended to instill a degree of\nfiscal discipline into the company, however managers were rarely on the lookout for\nprojects that would result in their budgets being cut, especially if that meant they would\nhave to lay off their employees as a result.\nWhen an RTCE project came down to final pricing, the team always faced another\nhandicap. Even though the team had developed some cost models that could be used to\nmake rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimates in real-time during the session (and\nvalidated their models to within a few percent), a formal costing effort would always\nfollow their work. Due to company tradition, and in the absence of another sanctioned\nmethod, all new prices were based on historical prices. Once the team completed its\ntechnical proposal, it would be forwarded to most of the functional managers for cost\nestimating. Each would examine the relative complexity of the proposed project as\ncompared to past projects. Some would then add in charges for new special projects\nthey wanted to use the new program to pay for, and would add in their own padding to\nensure that their department did not go over budget. A special cost team (separate from\nthe RTCE team) would then collect all of the cost estimates, roll them together, apply\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 80 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nthe corporate overhead rates and mandatory profit contribution, and then present a final\ncost to the executive management. Because the conceptual designers were not\ninvolved in this process, and due to the manual process of communicating the design\ndetails and cost items, the cost that was calculated could be for a different design that\nthe one actually being proposed. A special review board would then review the cost,\nthe company's strategic and competitive position, and then recommend a price that\nwould be offered to the potential customer. Using this method, the company was\ncompletely unable to match the reductions in price that their competitors were\nbeginning to offer - they were unable to estimate and account for the potential savings\nthat would be made due to the higher quality designs that the RTCE team had\nproduced.\nLastly, the accounting system employed by this company (and all others who\nperformed work for the Department of Defense), mandated strict enforcement of\ntimekeeping and charge numbers. Employees were audited periodically to make sure\nthat the time they spent at work was charged to the appropriate accounts. Once the\nR&D money for the RTCE project was depleted, this meant, in effect, that many\nemployees sat idle or stretched minor tasks for other programs that were funded instead\nof working efficiently on both other work and RTCE. Team members were actually\ndis-incentivised from using their spare time to work on RTCE or help out fellow team\nmembers because they did not have a charge number to reconcile their work with. The\nimplications for this system should be immediately apparent to any manager and were\nextremely disheartening to the RTCE team leaders.\nSection 4-E:\nDeep Dive: RTCE Metrics\nDespite the organizational impediments that have slowed the progress of the RTCE\nteam, they have been able to show tremendous success in their first crucial year of\noperation. Since the RTCE process became the standard new product design process in\nMarch of 2002, the team completed at least 10 new product proposals. They have\ntrimmed 33% of the lead time from their standard process, and are now capable of\ncreating new designs in as little as 4 hours - compared to up to 4 weeks previously.\nThe designs they do produce are of higher quality because they examine each option in\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 81 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\ngreater detail earlier in the design process by sharing thousands of design variables in\nreal time. The team also enjoyed very high morale early in its formation.\nOver the course of this project, the author collected performance data on nearly 100\nnew product proposal projects. Due to inconsistencies in the data or missing data\nitems, the list was reduced to 43 final project sets. These projects were sorted\naccording to the project scope. A subset of 36 of these projects - those classified as\n\"Major Projects\" - were further classified into following categories: year, use of RTCE\nand the number of designs considered. In order to provide additional context,\npersonnel data were obtained to determine the number of employees working on these\nprojects at any given time. The following table provides definitions of the key terms\nused in the process metrics provided below.\n(Term:\nMajor Project:\nrefined new design.\nMinor Project:\nIn response to a general,\nWithout RTCE:\nWith RTCE:\nThis label does not\nPoint Design:\nMultiple Trades:\nPage 82 of 180\nDefinition of RTCE METRICS\nDefinition)\nFormal proposal projects that begins with an official specification from a\npotential customer and results in the offering of a \"Firm, Fixed Price\" proposal for a highly\nA less formal response to a customer's inquiry.\nsomewhat flexible set of initial requirements, the team submits a \"Rough Order of\nMagnitude\" (ROM) estimated price and one or more design concepts.\nThis label refers to projects that were completed without the use of the\nReal Time Concurrent Engineering process.\nThis label refers to projects that included one or more Real Time Concurrent\nEngineering sessions in order to perform conceptual design work.\neliminate the possibility that some design work was done using the traditional decomposition\nmethod.\nThis label refers to projects that examined only one design architecture in\ndetail.

Stagney\nmore RTCE design sessions because they needed to examine design architectures in\ngreater detail. However, Minor projects considered more design options because of\ntheir less formal project deliverables - it was easier for them to carry more options\nforward because the amount of work required to present an option was far less than the\nformal cost, schedule and technical proposals that were required for each Major Design\nTrade. Often, potential customers use the Minor projects to help shape their business\nplans, so they actually request to see more design options. On Major projects,\ncustomers may send the same requirements to many potential suppliers and usually\naccept only one design option with each proposal so that they can very clearly compare\none supplier's offering to another. Also as expected, Minor projects had lower average\ncosts, costs per option and costs per completeness indices. This trend can be attributed\nto the less stringent demands on the quality and depth of each design option that Minor\nproject teams presented to each customer.

However, the new product development group\nis still performing better than it was in the 1999-2001 time frame. These data clearly\nshow reductions in the average cost of each project, the cost per design option, and the\ncost per completeness index. These trends validate all of the effort that the RTCE team\nhas contributed despite numerous structural, cultural, leadership and financial\nroadblocks. If these issues were to be adequately addressed, the results would be even\nmore dramatic.\nThe fact that the 2003 projects were slightly more expensive and less efficient than in\n2002 is in line with the observations noted at the beginning of Section 4-D.

New projects are being planned more deliberately,\nand holding to more fiscal discipline.

Stagney\nFigure 4-E-9 shows the total relative staffing levels, or \"equivalent personnel\" in the\nProduct Development group (the home department of the RTCE process team). The\nsource of the data is the company's time card database, which records the hours\ncharged by each person to each task. In order to protect proprietary data, the units have\nbeen removed from the graph. The most important observation is the highly cyclical\nnature of the volume of work performed by this department. Much of this pattern is\ndriven by the demands of the company's customers. The initial development and\nvalidation of the RTCE process accounts for the large spike in the \"technology /\nprocess improvement\" category between January and March 2002 and the increased\nlevel of \"management / overhead\" spending between November of 2001 and April of\n2002.\nWhen projects are under deadline, team members often work 50 or 60 hours a week (a\nrate of 1.25 to 1.5 \"equivalent personnel\" on the graph above). Additionally,\nspecialists may be brought in from other functional groups to assist on large projects.\nLikewise, when there are fewer proposals due, the staff of the product development\ngroup often fills their time by working for their individual functional managers -\ncharges that would show up in a separate projects category from the one shown above.\nThis arrangement can cause prioritization problems however. If a team member has\ncommitted to a project for his functional manager during a lull and an unexpected\nproposal project arises, scheduling conflicts cannot be avoided.\nFigure 4-E-10above shows the total number of Major and Minor projects completed by\nthe product development group.

The average score prior to the implementation was 0.72, and\nafterwards was 0.50. These data indicate that, on average, after the RTCE process was\nimplemented, productivity actually decreased, however there may be more than one\nexplanation for this observation.\nThe most important driver of this difference was the extremely low level of staff hours\ncharged between October and December of 2001. During this time, the author may\nhave been unable to obtain complete data, or an accounting error occurred - some of\nthe projects \"completed\" during those months may have been in-process for quite some\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 93 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B.

This metric is a generalized measure of the value-added work being\naccomplished within the department. It is calculated by taking the total number of\nproject units for each month and dividing by the average total staff level that charged\ntheir time to the \"project\" category in Figure 4-E-10.\nNext, the time period represented by the data may not long enough to show the actual\ntrend. The initial months of RTCE implementation were a time of learning and\nexperimentation - the team took their time to build a robust tool and often encountered\nsetbacks. In the long run, the leadership of the RTCE team was confident that the\nproductivity metric would show positive improvements.\nHowever, as explained previously, the productivity, or Return on Investment, metric\nshould not be the overarching measure of the success of the RTCE team. The increased\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 94 of 180\n0.20\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nquality, speed, accuracy, innovation and learning opportunities provided by the RTCE\nprocess will have profound benefits on the entire product lifecycle resulting in products\nthat deliver more value to customers and present less technical and financial risk to the\ncompany.\nSummary of RTCE Team Metrics\nOn average, in their first year RTCE projects cost 10% less than traditional projects.\nAlthough this was not the radical savings the team leaders had initially hoped for, the\nteam firmly believes that their costs will drop steadily as they continue to learn and\nimprove their process. It is still too early to calculate a traditional return on investment\n(ROI) metric for the savings generated by the RTCE process. However, the investment\ndid purchase the following:\nx\nOn average, using RTCE, each new product design project was able to\nconsider 64 percent more design options.\nx\nEach option is examined to 15 percent more detail.\nx\nAs measured by both the cost per option and cost per completeness metrics,\nthe RTCE team was 32 percent more productive than they had previously\nbeen.\nAs the first few projects that used the RTCE process move into production over the\nnext two years, the team is completely confident that the data will reveal that their\nability to examine more designs in greater detail early in the conceptual design process\nwill result in production programs that yield higher quality products that can be\nrepeatedly manufactured on-time and on-budget.\nSection 4-F:\nDeep Dive: Implementation of MATE-CON\nDuring the summer of 2002, the addition of a trade-tool capability was proposed to the\nRTCE team leadership. The concept was intended to enable the RTCE team to perform\nthe following functions:\nx Capture and prioritize customer preferences\nx Target regions of the potential design-space for closer examination\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 95 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nx Objectively compare one proposed design to another\nx Easily and objectively compare a proposed new design to past products\nthe company had successfully produced\nx Keep track of small iterations off of a proposed design, and evaluate if\neach was better or worse than the baseline\nx Evaluate a proposed design versus the best estimates of what know\ncompetitors would offer to the customer\nx Communicate in one visual graphic to managers and customers:\nx Communicate why a proposed design was chosen\nx Communicate how proposed designs were evaluated\nx Analyze and communicate the strengths and weaknesses of proposed\ndesigns, and determine how much it would cost in terms of time and\nmoney to eliminate each of the weaknesses\nThe MATE-CON process described in Chapter 3 was proposed as a method of\nproviding the above functions to the RTCE team. Unfortunately, the process has still\nnot been implemented due to a number of technical and cultural issues.\nOne team leader in particular was extremely enthusiastic about the use of MATE-CON.\nAlmost immediately after it was proposed, however, he struggled to find appropriate\nattributes of the systems that the team designed. In particular, the team typically had\nthree of four high-level requirements that could easily be turned into attributes - the\ntrade-offs between these were already well understood, however. The real need arose\nwhen the team traded off second-tier requirements, of which there were typically\nbetween 20 and 40. Since the current MATE-CON process can only accommodate up\nto seven attributes simultaneously, this situation presented a problem to the\nimplementation leader. A number of creative groupings were proposed, but in dong so,\nthe team would lose the ability to actually trade between the different parameters.\nAdditionally, going through the MATE-CON utility interview for a large number of\nattributes was time and reason-prohibitive. It was just too difficult to estimate the\nvalue of certain hypothetical systems, and the probability of success of each proposal.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 96 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nSecond, the team had a large disconnect between their design process and their\npotential customers. The nature of the industry they were in was heavily dependent on\na competitive bidding process that prevented open communication between the\ncompany and a customer during the proposal process. Typically, one senior manager\nwas assigned as the company's representative to the customer. MATE-CON was\npresented to several of them, but not one ever requested additional information or a\nmore detailed explanation. Most thought it was too complicated and completely\nunnecessary. The customer representatives believed that they provided all the\ninformation that the design team could possibly need. This was untrue in a few cases,\nalthough most of the customer representatives did not attend the concurrent design\nsessions or left \"after their part was done.\" This frustrated the design team because\nthey often had to make difficult choices based solely on their own guesses about what a\ncustomer might want, or were forced to do two or three complete designs in order to\nhave the representative choose one that might be presented to the customer.\nThird, in order to compare new proposals to existing designs using MATE-CON, the\nteam needed to access to historical data for all of the chosen attributes. The data were\nutterly unavailable to any team member. No centralized data storehouse was\nmaintained, and most project managers kept their own files according to what they\nthought was important, often leaving large pieces of information incomplete when they\ntransferred to other divisions, left the company, or were laid off. An extensive search\nof all available records was undertaken (totaling more than a month of the author's\ntime), but not enough information was located to complete the project.\nFinally, even if the team had wanted to implement the new process, the RTCE team\nwas not given the time or resources to develop a stand-alone MATE-CON tool that\ncould be integrated into a design session, nor did they have the ability to assign a team\nmember to operate it during a session. This, and the database project mentioned above,\nwere not the only areas of potential improvement that were picked up, then neglected\nagain and again by team members who volunteered to try them out in their free time\nbut simply did not have enough time or motivation to see them through.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 97 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nThe following is a summary of the lessons learned when the RTCE team attempted to\nimplement the MATE-CON process:\nx True customer collaboration is essential - this requires cooperation between\ndesigners, managers, sales and marketing people, and the customers themselves.\nx Trying to implement a new system is a risk, and many people will be afraid to\ntry new ideas because they are threatened by them.\nx Defining MATE-CON Attributes is labor intensive and requires skill and\npatience\nx The Utility Interview (which determines the utility curves used in a MATE\nCON analysis) is difficult and elicits the voice of only one key decision-maker\nat a time\nx Modeling the system at an appropriate level of detail takes discipline and\ncoordination\nx Parametric Models are difficult to construct\nx Need to incorporate error-checking and limits with closed form solutions in the\nmodels\nx Challenge: How to model systems that have never been tried before\nx Cost Models can be very influential\nx The basis for the models will drive your design - make sure you agree with the\nunderlying assumptions\nx If you base new costs on historical costs, you may never achieve new\ninnovations\nx MATE-CON is intended to be an iterative process\nx Users should maintain an open line of communication with key decision-makers\nand validate output continuously\nx Don't waste time in the beginning trying to make perfect models\nx Go for a uniform accuracy target (+/- 5%) at first, then hone in on the important\nareas of the tradespace and improve your models\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 98 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nSection 4-G:\nStrategies for Near Term Re-Vitalization of the RTCE Team\nAs is the case at most aerospace companies, when it comes to project implementations,\nthe strong engineering heritage of the company guides the organization along the most\ncomfortable path: technology. Engineers - and managers who were once engineers -\nare fantastic problem solvers. When faced with the challenges listed above, the RTCE\nteam reacted in the way they were trained and rewarded for acting throughout their\ncareers - by proposing and implementing strong technical solutions to the most\ntangible problems, and leaving the rest for another day.\nFigure 4-G-1: The \"TPP\" Model shows the interaction of the \"Technology (T),\" \"People\n(Pe),\" and \"Process (Pr)\" issues that dominate any project implementation. All three\nareas must be addressed in proportion in order to achieve process harmony. Actions\ntaken in each category help the efforts in other categories to become more effective.\nThrough observation and collaboration, the author is proposing a new model through\nwhich the positive achievements and the potentially damaging issues delineated in the\nprevious sections can be highlighted and addressed. Figure 4-G-1 shows a pictorial\nrepresentation of the careful balance that must be struck between Technology, People\nand Process in order for any project to be successfully implemented. A similar\nframework was proposed by (Neff and Presley, 2000), after the implementation of a\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 99 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nsimilar team at the Aerospace Corporation As the RTCE team learned first hand,\nregardless of the potential value that a new innovation can create, the implementation\nteam must examine and solve problems in all three categories. If a team focuses\ndisproportionately on the technical challenges, the project will encounter people and\nprocess issues that will impair their progress or negate the value they have created.\nTechnology: In the span of approximately 9 months, the RTCE team transformed the\nICE concept into a working reality. The team can now design low to medium NRE\n(non-recurring engineering) products in approx 4 to 12 hours compared to 2 to 4 weeks\nusing their previous approach. Nineteen subsystem clients (ICE functional analysis\ntools) were written and technically validated. Over 7200 universal design variables\nwere created, assigned and made accessible to every team member. A robust data\nmanagement system was created and implemented. Automatic documentation tools -\nan idea initiated by team members as a process improvement - were added to each\nclient.\nIn the next year, the team has several tasks that need to be accomplished in order to\naddress some of the technical issues highlighted in the previous section. First, a sub-\nteam must meet with representatives from the operations division in order to integrate\ntheir expertise into the real-time concurrent design sessions. New clients must be\ncreated as appropriate in order to provide the RTCE team with more accurate cost,\nlead-time and schedule information. Other ICE teams at JPL, Caltech and MIT employ\n3-D visualization techniques so that designers can use their intuition to better\nunderstand how their subsystems will come together to form a high-performance\nmachine. The RTCE should first implement a very low-cost, high-level tool such as\nDrawcraft which links the designer's excel spreadsheet to SolidWorks(r), a solid\nmodeling tool (Liu, 2000). Once the team explores the benefits and difficulties of this\nnew capability, they can then deploy a complex tool such as Pro-E(r). The RTCE team\nmust find a way to integrate historical data for comparison purposes. Finally, they\nmust implement a rigorous and objective group decision-making methodology, such as\nMIT's MATE-CON process, in order to explore the product architectures they create\nwith respect to their customer's stated values (Diller, 2002).\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 100 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nPeople: The original RTCE team kicked off the project with a high level of\nenthusiasm and energy. They were excited about a new way of doing business and\nknew that their leadership had committed significant resources to the success of the\nproject (i.e. the entire overhead budget for the next year).\nAs discovered in the previous section, however, human issues slowed the team's\nprogress and created conflicting messages. The RTCE project should be staffed with\nfull-time dedicated personnel (Browning, 1996) and (Klein and Susman, 1995). This\nstanding team will avoid conflicts of time, energy or loyalty and promote process\nimprovement at an accelerated pace (Pomponi, 1998) (however, the modular structure\nof the RTCE process allows for subject-matter experts to be added as necessary, and\nfor on-the-job training of new team members). It should consist of people from all\nfunctional and business departments - especially from marketing and operations. Team\nmembers should be chosen on the basis of their energy, cooperative spirit,\ninnovativeness and system-level perspective as well as technical competence. There\nshould be a healthy mix of \"knowers\" and \"learners.\" The experienced seniors can\nhelp guide the team towards designs that will be less expensive to manufacture and that\navoid failures that have taken place in the past, while the younger team members can\nhelp provide the real time, analytical horse-power the team will need to carry out its\nmission.\nThese team members should come together to establish common values and work\nnorms. The leadership should effectively communicate their expectations to the team,\nand should explicitly evaluate and reward individuals and the team when expectations\nare met. The team should also create a forum for the training of new team members\nas well as an opportunity for others in the company to visit and learn about their\nprocess. Ergonomically, the team leaders should ensure that the team's homeroom is\nclean and quiet, that the temperature is comfortable and that all team members' human\nneeds are tended to so that people can perform at their maximum potential.\nProcess: There are a number of key process achievements that the RTCE team was\nresponsible for. They successfully integrated RTCE into the company's new proposal\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 101 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nprocess. At this time, all new business opportunities utilize this innovative new\ntechnique. The team developed session scripting which enables people to understand\nthe current focus of the design session, to facilitate information sharing and to keep the\nsession flowing smoothly. The use of the \"around-the-room\" method allows each team\nmember to share their input and have visibility to underlying assumptions and problem\nareas.\nTo complete the TPP analysis, the RTCE team should continue to focus on process\nimprovement. They must create a feedback mechanism so that team members can\nvoice opinions and implement their own process improvement ideas rather than leaving\nthat burden exclusively to the team leadership. Metrics and goals should be posted and\nevaluated daily with a focus on continuous improvement. The team must avoid sub\noptimization by encouraging system-level solutions even if one or two subsystems are\nless efficient than they would otherwise be. During the design sessions, two leaders are\nrequired to focus on different aspects of the process so that each team member can be\nfree from administrative burdens. Having one leader who focuses on the technical\naspects of the system and another that deals only with the smooth flow of the process\nwill enable the team to operate at their maximum efficiency and have time to think\ninnovatively.\nThe author also provided a roadmap for the integration of RTCE processes and\nconcepts into the other phases of product design, manufacturing and test (Refer to\nSection B of Chapter 6). In the first phase of this effort, the RTCE team would\nenhance their current capabilities as described in the previous paragraphs. In Figure 4-\nG-2, the round circles that surround the ICE homeroom graphic indicate these\nadditional team resources. Each circle could represent subsystem experts, additional\nteam members, databases, or even small teams of suppliers or others who are available\nto assist the RTCE team during a design session.\nNext, the team would build a \"negotiation tool\" that would help them rapidly provide\ndetailed technical and financial updates to the negotiation team that is typically sent to\nfinalize and sign a contract with each new customer. During the course of these\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 102 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nnegotiations (which typically occur in the offices of the customer), the negotiation team\nis often asked to sign up for increased performance or lower costs than initially offered\nin their written proposal. Using this new \"ICE-on-a-laptop\" capability, the team would\nbe able to accurately evaluate the customer's requests and be able to show the customer\nthe impacts or benefits of particular options. The tool they would carry with them to\nthe negotiation session would be a high-level extraction of the full RTCE parametric\nmodel. It would have certain \"design knobs\" that could be tuned, but would also have\na series of pre-determined 'limits' that would notify the negotiation team if they need to\nconvene a full RTCE design session back home in order to update the proposal.\nNegotiation\nTeam\nInternal\nExternal\nSuppliers\nSuppliers\nOther\nExpert\ns\nFigure 4-G-2: The off-site Negotiation Team is supported by the primary design team at\nhome who are in turn supported by additional stakeholders and experts.\nIn the next phase of expansion, the RTCE process and models would become the\nbackbone of all detailed design work that occurs after the company has won a new\nproject. In the current system, the output of the RTCE team is mostly discarded\nbecause it is not in the format that can be used by the detailed designers, nor do they\ntrust the analysis that was performed by people they do not know. In the proposed\nconcept, the original RTCE team would gradually hand off ownership of the models\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 103 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nand processes as a program comes to life. As more detailed work begins, teams of\nspecialists can be added to support the main RTCE team. So, instead of having one\nsubsystem model, an entire RTCE team could be plugged in to the system. The overall\nsystem model would be 'synchronized' on a daily or weekly basis by the main team in\norder to monitor the progress of the design work. These meetings would highlight new\nchanges or issues that have arisen - designers would still be working with parametric\nmodels so they would be able to detect the impact that changes would have on their\nsubsystems, and the project managers would be able to keep the team on schedule and\non-budget by pacing the tasks that are to be completed by each update session.\nFigure 4-G-3: Other ICE teams are formed to support the primary design team. Their\nmodels are linked parametrically to the master product design.\nOnce the product design is complete and the team is ready to begin fabrication, the\nRTCE facility and models become valuable tools for monitoring the progress of\nhardware integration and performance with respect to the predicted values. If particular\nsubsystems do not perform as specified, the models can help the team quickly assess\nthe potential impact of the discrepancy and determine an accurate disposition. The\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 104 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nsystem would also help the team perform and document complex system tests.\nOptimally, the manufacturing facility would be directly adjacent to the team homeroom\nso that the entire team can coordinate their activities and again see the impacts of their\ndecisions in real time.\nPre-Assembly\nStaging Areas\nFinal Integratio\n/\nn\nand Test Area\nFigure 4-G-4: Collocation of Design and Fabrication Facilities for\neach new ICEnterprise will increase visibility and communication\nand keep the team focused on the smooth flow of operations in\norder to ensure on-time delivery.\nSection 4-H: Summary of Organizational Implications and Recommendations\nSummary of Organizational Implications:\nx The nature of the company's organizational structure created barriers between\nthe RTCE team, and the critical people and information they needed.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 105 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nx Managers of other divisions within the company did not see the potential\npositive impact that RTCE could have on the company as a whole. This lack of\nbuy-in manifested itself in the form of minimal support that detracted from the\npotential gains the team could make.\nx The company's senior management team did not adequately understand the\nvision for the RTCE project. This was partly due to their focus on short-term\nprofitability and partly because the RTCE leadership was unable to articulate a\ncohesive message to the proper audience.\nx RTCE participants were thrust into entirely new types of jobs, and their\ntraining, motivation and incentives were not yet properly aligned with their new\nresponsibilities.\nx Managers in peer departments judged the project based on second-hand\ninformation and with respect to their own personal agendas.\nx The RTCE leadership team faced difficult personnel and management issues yet\nlacked the authority or the mandate to make tough decisions and push team\nmembers to make changes outside of their comfort zones.\nx Rather than enabling positive change, the company's accounting system\nprevented well-intentioned people from spending their time on work that would\nhelp make the company more profitable in the future.\nAuthor's Conclusions on the RTCE team:\nThe real-time concurrent engineering team has created a jeweled \"island of success\"\nwithin their company (Murman, 2002). The team successfully brought about change\nduring a complex and uncertain period of time. They applied innovative solutions to\nemerging technology, personnel and process challenges. The team worked\npassionately from their initial positions and reached out beyond the safe boundaries of\ntheir existing job descriptions. The organization around them responded defensively -\nthe company had reached its current size and market dominance by forming a strong\nculture that resisted change. It gained efficiency through standardization, training and\ninstitutionalization - its customers paid for absolute predictability and reliability, not\nfor unproven experiments, and the employees behaved accordingly.\nThe RTCE team leaders have successfully pushed beyond the boundaries of their home\ndepartment. If the company is ever going to realize the tremendous technical and\nstrategic value that the real-time concurrent engineering process can provide, the\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 106 of 180\n\nThe Integrated Concurrent Enterprise\nDavid B. Stagney\nproject must be supported and nurtured at the highest levels of the organization. The\nPresident must lay out a clear vision and follow through on a methodical expansion of\nthe scope and impact of RTCE. The senior leadership should choose the most\nimportant attributes of this new business system - namely the continuity and universal\naccessibility of design information - and instill these as core values throughout the\ncompany. Next, the senior leadership should avoid the temptation to freeze and\nstandardize the process as done with specific technical tools. Rather, they must foster\nan air of excitement and invention. They should clearly articulate the problems that the\ncompany is facing, and then describe in detail how a new approach that links all the\nkey functions of the company in a manner never before possible, will provide a path\ntoward sustainable success. There will be many new challenges along this path, but an\napproach that balances the technical, people and process issues will ultimately lead to\nlong term, enterprise-wide value creation.\n(c)Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2003\nPage 107 of 180"

placed me in a terrific position to\nrecognize best practices in lean manufacturing. I had previously been involved in basic\nlean manufacturing processes. Aerospace Improvement Workshops (AIWs), or kaizen\nevents, were initialized by Boeing and spread to their suppliers. I was involved with\nseveral of these kaizens and their preparations at Moog, Inc. before coming to the\nLeaders For Manufacturing program.\nIn my experience, these kaizen events seemed to be the pinnacle of the Toyota\nProduction System. I learned throughout the program and in my experience at Eastman\nKodak Co. that kaizen is the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Kaizen events are one of many\ndifferent techniques within the Toyota Production System that make the system effective.\n1.1 Lean enterprise activities at Eastman Kodak Co.\nI had the opportunity to work in the Kodak Operating System (KOS) office at Kodak.\nThe KOS office was the central lean office that advances lean principles throughout\nEastman Kodak Company. It based its activities on the Toyota production system. The\nKOS office had representatives within most manufacturing flows. It attempted to retain\nand build lean knowledge in manufacturing by facilitating a variety of activities,\nincluding kaizen improvement events. The creation of the \"Enterprise KOS\" office\nmarks the organizational beginning to develop a lean extended enterprise.\nAlthough there are many techniques, there are several key principles to lean production\nand also the lean extended enterprise. In the words of Taiichi Ohno, one of the primary\nfounders of lean production,\nAll we are doing is looking at the time line; from the moment the customer\ngives us an order to the point when we collect cash. And we are reducing\nthat time line by removing the non-value-added wastes (Ohno ix).\nThe opportunity to work in a lean production office as effective and energetic as the\nKodak Operating System office was inspiring. They had a remarkable ability to bring\nexternal ideas and energy into Eastman Kodak Co., as well as involving every part of the\norganization to institutionalize both the vision and techniques of TPS.\nDuring my previous experience, I had primarily been involved in value stream mapping,\n5S, and kaizen activities. I expanded my mental model for the reasons behind kaizen\nactivities. They should have been directed at problems that continuous improvement\nfrom the shop floor could not overcome on their own without external brainstorming and\ninitiative. Therefore, as I came to quickly realize at KOS, there were many more\ntechniques and tactics in TPS. Some of these included:\n\n- Level production volume and product mix (heijunka)\n- Base production plans on customers' order volume (genryo seisan, takt)\n- Reduce setup change time and lot size\n- Piece-by-piece transfer of parts between processes (ikko-nagashi)\n- Flexible task assignment for volume change, productivity improvement (shojinka)\n- Multitask job assignment along the process flow (takotei-mochi)\n- U-shape machine layout that facilitates flexible and multiple task assignment\n- Automatic detection of defects and automatic shutdown of machines (jidoka)\n- Foolproof prevention of defects (poka-yoke)\n- Assembly line stop cord (andon cord)\n- Real-time feedback of production troubles (andon signboard)\n- On-the-spot inspection by direct workers\n- Separation of value-adding from non-value adding work (mizusumashi)\n- Building-in quality (tsukurikomi)\n- Cleanliness, order, discipline on the shop floor (5-S)\n- Visual management\n- Frequent revision of standard operating procedures (standard work improvement)\n- Quality circles\n- Standardized tools for quality improvement (7 tools for QC, QC story)\n- Worker involvement in preventive maintenance (total productive maint./TPM)\n- Low-cost automation or semi-automation with just enough functions\n- Production Preparation Process (3P)\nThe Kodak Operating System office was keenly aware of the difficulties in integrating\nthe diverse techniques of TPS to make the system function. They created a powerful\nsymbol for this challenge of every company attempting to improve their processes. This\nsymbol was a puzzle with the different techniques. None of these techniques represent\nthe essence of the Toyota Production System alone. They must be part of a philosophy\nand vision that sustains each of these techniques in the quest for an integrated lean\nextended enterprise. The KOS \"puzzle\" is illustrated below:\nFigure 1.1.1 Kodak Operating System \"Puzzle\"\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nA common symbol used to represent the components of the Toyota Production System is\nthe \"House of TPS.\" Although there are different versions of the house, many share a\ncommon theme: the use of different techniques to support an integrated production\nsystem. This is exemplified below:\nFigure 1.1.2 \"House\" of the Toyota Production System illustrates variety of techniques\nThe pillars of the house, namely Just-In-Time (JIT) and jidoka, are important but alone\ncannot provide an integrated view of TPS. They must be supported by heijunka as well\nas accompanied by the plethora of other techniques.\nAnother insight I found particularly important was the distinction between process kaizen\nand system kaizen. Kaizen is commonly thought of simply as \"continuous\nimprovement.\" The KOS office tried to build continuous improvement into the everyday\nworkings of Kodak production. In this way, kaizen was called only when the lowest-\nlevel group with responsibility and the most knowledge of the process were having\nextreme difficulty achieving a breakthrough in normal improvement. In this way, kaizen\nwas used to gather a focused short-term research team to break small roadblocks for\nimproved processes or systems. Both process and system kaizen were important to\ncontinuing and gaining benefits from the improvement process. However, process kaizen\nwas generally required before proceeding to system kaizen. Insufficient process\ncapability sometimes constrained system improvements. Therefore, process kaizen must\nbe focused in advance to prepare for system kaizen.\nFigure 1.1.3 Kodak Operating System Process/System Kaizen mental model\n\n1.2 Motivation\nThis thesis was developed to explore the impacts of decisions made in supply chains.\nTypically these decisions are made in order to locally optimize certain sections of a value\nstream. However, these decisions have substantial technical and organizational impacts\nthat are separated in both time and space. Managers need to develop an intuition for\nthese tradeoffs in today's complex enterprises. This intuition needs to include both\ntechnical aspects, like an understanding of the ramifications of the bullwhip effect on the\ncost structure of supply chains, and organizational aspects, like the loss of learning in\nsupply chains that follow and amplify this volatility. These intuitions have important\nimplications for theory, including the theory of the firm and the use of scientific\nanalogies to build our understanding of complex systems.\n1.3 Organization\nThe thesis follows a direction of initially broad scope, followed by focused project\ncontent. This is subsequently followed by expanded scope in application towards theory.\nProject\n(technical)\nProject\n(organizational)\nLiterature Review\nTheory\nChapter 3 -\nChapter 4 -\nChapter 2 -\nChapter 5 -\nFigure 1.3.1 Thesis scope is narrowed and subsequently broadened\nChapter 2 reviews relevant literature. This review includes a several subject areas that\nare relevant to lean enterprises. Chapter 3 analyzes the project from a technical point of\nview. This analysis includes discussion of a training simulation, model, analysis, and\nimplementation. Chapter 4 describes organizational processes relevant to the project.\nChapter 5 describes relevant theory and applications. Chapter 6 presents conclusions.\n\nChapter 2: Literature Review\nThere is a growing literature on the lean enterprise. This can be classified into several\nareas: supply chain & operations research, logistics, operations and technology strategy,\norganizational strategy, historical taxonomies, prescriptive accounts, and MIT resources.\n2.1 Supply Chain & Operations Research (OR)\nThe majority of supply chain and operations research literature focus on operations that\noptimize information and material flows within an existing transaction-based enterprise.\nMost of this surrounds a variety of patterns, like the bullwhip effect, and mitigation\ntechniques, like Quick Response (QR), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), and\nCollaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR).\nChen, Zrezner, Ryan, and Simchi-Levi developed a seminal paper on information\nstrategies named \"Quantifying the Bullwhip Effect in a Simple Supply Chain: The Impact\nof Forecasting, Lead Times, and Information.\" The paper clarified that the bullwhip\neffect can be reduced, but not completely eliminated, by centralizing demand\ninformation. This was important to consider for this project. Most managers assume that\nimproving information flows will solve the bullwhip. The conclusion supports the use of\nproduction leveling in lean extended enterprises to protect the chain and enable\nsystematic reduction in supply chain costs through learning.\nGerard Cachon and Marshall Fisher wrote \"Supply Chain Inventory Management and the\nValue of Shared Information.\" Their primary finding was that implementing information\ntechnology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is\nsignificantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of\ninformation. It assumed one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic\nconsumer demand with inventory holding and back-order penalty costs. The conclusion\ncould be subordinated to Chen's basic finding that improving information flows do not\nattack the root cause of demand amplification in supply chains.\nStephen Graves wrote a paper titled \"A Single-Item Inventory Model for a Non-\nStationary Demand Process.\" This provided an important conclusion that there is no\nvalue to allowing upstream stages to see exogenous downstream demand. It assumed a\nnon-stationary demand process (IMA of order (0,1,1)). It finds that the demand process\nfor the upstream stage is not only non-stationary but also more variable than that for the\ndownstream stage. This finding bolsters Cachon's conclusion that improving the breadth\nof information flows is not a high leverage point.\nYossi Aviv wrote two effective papers on collaborative forecasting: \"The Effect of\nCollaborative Forecasting on Supply Chain Performance\" and \"Gaining Benefits from\nJoint Forecasting and Replenishment Processes: The Case of Auto-Correlated Demand.\"\nThe first article concluded that firms interested in collaborative forecasting need to have\nunique forecasting capabilities. Aviv also found that the benefits of collaborative\nforecasting increase when implemented in conjunction with Quick Response programs\n\nand advanced demand information. The second article built off Graves' insights with\nintegration of non-stationary demand into assumptions for information sharing. He found\nthat \"in implementation of VMI programs, it is crucial to ascertain that the supplier will\nbe capable of observing and incorporating early demand signals that are at least as\ninformative as those observed by the retailer; otherwise, collaborative forecasting may be\nnecessary, and if not justified, LMI may be the best choice ...\" (Aviv 71). The concept\nof unique forecasting capabilities is important for the effectiveness of improving the\nbreadth of information flow. Firms should either utilize fundamentally different sources\nof information and expand the breadth or use demand leveling to prevent amplification.\nLi et al. wrote an intriguing article titled \"The Effects of Information Sharing Strategies\non Supply Chain Performance.\" It found that under situations of high demand variability,\na hybrid information sharing strategy is superior to several alternatives, including order\ninformation sharing, final consumer demand sharing, inventory information sharing, and\nshipment information sharing. This hybrid strategy would combine final consumer\ndemand with inventory information sharing to improve the overall performance of the\nsupply chain when variability of demand mix is high. This analysis was applicable since\nboth our total volume demand variability was high combined with extremely high\nvariability in mix. However, demand leveling was not included in the analysis.\nChen wrote a working paper titled \"Information Sharing and Supply Chain\nCoordination.\" The base-stock supply chain model was argued to provide a smoother\ndemand process for upstream, yet using reorder points established the lower cost for the\nextended enterprise. He argued \"it is dangerous if we take as our goal the reduction or\nelimination of the bullwhip effect...the existence of the bullwhip effect is only a\ncharacteristic of an operating policy, which reflects the economic forces underlying the\nsupply chain. It is a symptom, not a problem\" (Chen 32). Therefore, Chen saw the\nchallenge of the bullwhip effect as a tradeoff of demand variability reduction versus\nhigher system cost. Heijunka processes need to be considered in this juxtaposition,\npotentially breaking this \"tyranny of the or\" for the \"possibility of the and,\" in which a\nlean extended enterprise can both reduce signal variability and reduce system costs.\nA variety of this research also focused on inventory postponement and Strategic\nInventory Placement (SIP). After initial attempts to analyze the supply chain with an SIP\nmodel, the author discovered implementation difficulties with this approach for Eastman\nKodak Co.'s operational strategy. These strategies required increased upstream\nflexibility from the current state that utilized the stability from the pacemaker process.\nThe KOS office was confident the demand leveling strategy provided the foundation\nupon which upstream system improvements and system kaizen could reduce upstream\ninventories and more than offset costs involved with strategically placing inventory\ndownstream.\n\n2.2 Logistics\nThe majority of logistics solutions were found in Vehicle Routing studies. This research\ninitially looked at optimizing a fixed fleet of trucks for logistics. However, it was\nexpanded to include routing inventory to various locations as well as more generalized\nmodels. It focused on optimizing and updating routes for pickup and delivery with the\nappropriate constraints. There was an extremely wide base of literature in this area. The\nmost prominent piece of research came out of the Georgia Institute of Technology,\nprimarily through Savelsbergh. I have included several important works in the\nbibliography for the readers' interest.\nA good introduction to this research is Sarmiento and Nagi's work \"A Review of\nIntegrated Analysis of Production-Distribution Systems.\" This classified models into\ndistribution-inventory, inventory-distribution-inventory, and production-inventory-\ndistribution-inventory types. It described critical model assumptions, including expedited\ndelivery, number of locations, stochastic or deterministic flows, and whether routing/milk\nruns are involved. This review was helpful given the wide variety of assumptions built\ninto these models.\nErtogral, Wu, and Burke attempt to remedy some of the difficulties with these pure\nfunctional approaches in \"Coordination Production and Transportation Scheduling in the\nSupply Chain.\" Many models can be bucketed into the Multi-Level Multi-Item Dynamic\nCapacitated Lot Sizing Problem (MLMILP). Others can be grouped into transportation\nplanning problems, as stated above with vehicle routing and scheduling. These range\nfrom the basic traveling salesman problem to the multi-vehicle pickup and delivery\nproblem with time windows (m-PDPTW). This approach integrated decisions from these\nmodels and identified key trade-offs between production and transportation.\nAlthough these were all useful models, they did not allow for the appropriate level of\nintegration of supply assumptions as well as demand assumptions for applicability\ntowards the individual project and business unit. They also led to extremely large Integer\nProgramming (IP) models. The challenge of heijunka controlled production supplying\nextremely variable demand, with a small number of \"drop\" sites to choose from, made\nmost of these models inappropriate for Kodak's lean enterprise. However, it is a rich\nportfolio of research with possibilities for development in lean extended enterprises.\n2.3 Operations and Technology Strategy\nThe theoretical work presented will extend Prof. Charles Fine's work on the theory of\nclockspeed. This work developed theory behind sources of industry dynamics.\n\"Three Dimensional Concurrent Engineering (3DCE)\", or the ability to simultaneously\ndesign products, processes, and supply chains, was proposed as a source of competitive\nadvantage in the age of temporary advantage.\n\nFigure 2.3.1 Double Helix depicting evolution of industry/product structure (Fine, 49).\nAs the clockspeed ideas around 3DCE developed, Fine developed the challenge of\n\"Technology Roadmapping.\" This attempted to create an understanding of the\ninteractions between five key dynamics, or the \"Five Cogs.\" The \"Five Cogs\" included\ndynamics of government and regulation, business cycles, industry structures, corporate\nstrategies, and technologies.\nFigure 2.3.2 Five Cogs of Technology Roadmapping (Fine, lecture Spring 2002)\nFine's notion of clockspeed was complemented by Clayton Christensen's ideas around\ndisruptive innovation. According to Christensen's notion of the \"Innovator's Dilemma,\"\nincumbent firms are frequently displaced by newcomers because of rigidities developed\nfrom overserving their markets with sustaining business models. Lower performance\ndisruptive business models initially take over lower tiered and lower margin markets,\ndeveloping their performance to displace incumbent firms.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nFigure 2.3.3 The \"Innovator's Dilemma\" (Christensen, 17)\nChristensen linked this concept with the architecture literature. He argued sustaining\nbusiness models compete through functionality using an integral architecture, while\ndisruptive business models compete through speed and customization using a modular\narchitecture.\nFigure 2.3.4 Sources of Competitive Advantage (Christensen, 147)\nThe author further argued that many Japanese firms, including lean extended enterprises\nlike Toyota, had disruptive business models that evolved into sustaining business models\nfocusing increasingly on upper tiers of customers.\n\"Toyota attacked the lowest tiers of the North American\nautomobile market in the 1960s with its Corona model. Over time,\nthis strategy created new growth markets. The cars were so simple\nand ultimately so reliable that they became second cars in the\ngarages of middle-income Americans. This track worked until\nToyota encountered competition in this tier from other Japanese\ncompanies such as Datsun (Nissan), Honda, and Mazda. To\nmaintain its profit margins, Toyota then introduced models\ntargeted at more demanding consumers-first the Corolla and the\nTercel, then the Camry, the 4Runner, and the Lexus, and finally\nthe Avalon line\" (Christensen et al., 86)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nBoth these approaches assumed there was a correct strategic balance between value\ncreation, delivery, and capture. This was an interesting proposition developed by\nHenderson and continued in Technology Strategy classes at the MIT Sloan School.\nFigure 2.3.5 Balance the three components of value (Nicholas, 4).\nMichael Hammer wrote two interesting books on reengineering. His model of the\nreengineering process was an interesting approach to change management.\nReengineering was essentially high level incremental innovation to remove non-value\nadded waste from business processes. In certain ways, it was similar to the Production\nPreparation Process (3P) at Kodak. Both 3P and reengineering were utilized as novel\nways of introducing new products or business processes. In addition to these functions,\n3P was utilized for fundamental changes in demand, product design changes, and new\nplant introductions. Although there are many similarities between reengineering and lean\nwith their focus on reducing non-value added waste, reengineering can be seen as one of\nmany other lean techniques.\nFigure 2.3.7 Reengineering Process (Hammer, MIT guest lecture 03/31/2003)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\n2.4 Alliances\nThe majority of strategic alliance literature defined strategic alliances and described the\nprocesses of their strategy, formation, and maintenance. Alliances can be segmented\nbetween the level of commitment: transactional, strategic, and permanent alliances. They\ncan also be differentiated by the level of control.\nFigure 2.4.1 Strategic alliances enhance commitment and have hybrid governance\n(Harbison & Pekar, 4)\nThe majority of lean extended enterprise alliances fall into the strategic alliance segment.\nGulati, Ring, and Gomes-Casseres are other authors cover basic strategic alliances.\nDyer distilled alliance tasks into an alliance life cycle with specific processes.\nFigure 2.4.2 Alliances have predictable life cycle stages and processes (Dyer et al., 40)\nThe best literature I found on strategic alliances came from Doz and Hamel's Alliance\nAdvantage. The powerful message emanating from the book was the partitioning of\nalliance logic between co-option, cospecialization, and competence learning.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nFigure 2.4.3 Logic of alliance value creation, delivery, and capture (Doz & Hamel, 36)\nIn addition to life cycle processes, Doz and Hamel analyzed effective alliance logic\ncombinations.\nFigure 2.4.4 Lean extended enterprises use robust alliance patterns (Doz&Hamel, 107)\nLean extended enterprises like Airbus tended to combine all three logics of co-option,\ncospecialization, and internalization in order to create, deliver, and capture value.\nExtended enterprises that are less effective tended to ignore strategic, organizational, and\ncultural compatibility constraints.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\n2.5 Organizational Strategy\nRobert Gibbons developed a series of concepts around relational contracts and the\nboundary of the firm. He argued a new perspective that the relationship between parties\nis most important and that the make/buy decision should be subjected to this relationship.\nThere were four main points to his argument:\n1. ownership can stop hold-up\n2. using formal instruments to stop one hold-up problem typically creates another\n3. relational contracts offer important advantages over formal contracts and\nownership structures, but is vulnerable to reneging\n4. implementing the best feasible relational contract requires optimizing the\nboundary of the firm\nGibbons argued that relational contracts are contingent on the environment, not\ninherently efficient, and path dependent. His research supports the empirical findings\nthat lean extended enterprises leverage effective relational contracts against mass\nenterprise competition. These enterprises mitigate reneging on relational contracts\nthrough a variety of measures, including employee transfers (shukko) and dual primary\nsupplier contracting.\n2.6 Prescriptive Accounts\nThe best introduction to TPS was Monden's Toyota Production System. It included\nterrific detail and integration between the logic, methodology, and techniques. The logic\nbetween some of the techniques is illustrated below.\nFigure 2.6.1 Logic behind Toyota Production System (Monden, 73)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nJones' and Womack's Seeing the Whole: Mapping the Extended Value Stream was an\nintroductory work into methods to explicitly define and quantify the value stream across\nthe extended enterprise. The logic of the approach was well defined:\n- Raise consciousness in every firm and function of the enormous waste in the\ncurrent state\n- Raise consciousness in every firm and function of the effect of its actions on\nevery other function and firm touching the value stream\n- Learn how a value stream team with representatives from every firm can envision\na series of Future States and an Ideal State for their shared value streams\n- Learn how the team can progressively implement:\no A Future State 1 in which smooth, leveled pull and flow are introduced\nwithin every facility touching the value stream\no A Future State 2 in which smooth, leveled pull and frequent replenishment\nloops are introduced between every facility touching the value stream\n(eliminating warehousing and cross-docking in the process)\no An Ideal State by compressing the value stream and introducing right-\nsized technologies\n- Learn how the value stream teams can share costs and gains to create win-win-\nwin outcomes for every value stream participant (Jones 2002).\nFollowing these steps, the KOS office attempted to raise consciousness in executive\nmanagement of the enormous waste in the current state as well as the effect of actions\ntaken at different stages in the supply chain. Through the model and business case, the\nproject attempted to learn how to achieve a Future State. Additional Future States\nincluded techniques like milk runs, effective pacemaker activity, and direct connection\ninto customer processes.\nJeffrey Dyer established a prescriptive account for organizations attempting to develop a\nlean extended enterprise in Collaborative Advantage. He used empirical evidence from\nToyota's enterprise to extrapolate issues for the creation of a lean extended enterprise.\nHis mental model grew out of the transaction cost viewpoint, in that he identified the\nthree key sources of competitive advantage as dedicated asset investments, knowledge-\nsharing routines, and interfirm trust.\nFigure 2.6.2 Transaction cost sources of advantage for lean enterprises (Dyer, 38)\nDedicated assets were embodied in site specialization, physical asset specialization, and\nhuman specialization. Toyota used a variety of techniques to facilitate knowledge\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nsharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge, including supplier associations, on-site\nconsulting, supplier learning teams (jishuken/PDA groups), problem-solving teams,\nemployee transfers (shukko), and performance feedback with process monitoring.\nFigure 2.6.3 Organizational learning mechanisms at Toyota (Dyer, 64)\nLearning developed through a multitude of methods at Toyota. For the extended\nenterprise, these were primarily driven by the supplier association, consulting divisions,\nand supplier learning teams (jishuken).\nFigure 2.6.4 Lean extended enterprise learning organizations at Toyota (Dyer, 32)\nDyer argued that trust reduced transactions costs, lead to superior knowledge sharing, and\nfacilitated investments in dedicated assets. Finally, Dyer described lessons for\nimplementation of lean enterprises, including developing subnetworks, multilateral\nrelationships, and reciprocity by the lead firm.\nSako developed an interesting extension of Dyer's work on learning mechanisms in lean\nextended enterprises. He compared and contrasted these learning mechanisms across\nthree extended enterprises: Toyota, Nissan, and Honda. There were important similarities\nand differences between approaches that determined the extent of \"lean\" in extended\nenterprises. Three interesting similarities were found:\n1. The recipients of supplier development assistance were divided into an inner\ngroup, who received tacit hands-on process assistance, and an outer group, who\nwere limited to improvement incentives like long-term agreements\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\n2. Multiple channels of supplier development were offered. This balanced between\nself/mutual learning amongst suppliers and more heavy-handed assistance for\nimmediate tangible results.\n3. The scope of supplier development activity got broader and deeper in practice.\nAlthough there were similarities, Toyota's extended enterprise was leaner as a result of\ntwo primary differences. The resulting differences are also illustrated below.\n- Toyota shared actual practices above and beyond representation of routines in\ncontrast to Honda and Nissan.\n- Toyota developed enabling practices to support the evolutionary learning process.\nThese include excluding direct rivals from group learning processes and\ndeveloping a bifurcated structure to support detailed learning from internal\nfactories shielding from commercial negotiations. (Sako, 27-29).\nFigure 2.6.5 Lean extended enterprises focus on evolutionary learning (Sako, 40)\nToyota understood the necessity to teach evolutionary capability development throughout\nthe production network. This fundamental realization was crucial to maintaining and\nfurthering their relative competitive advantage throughout the 1980's and 1990s. As a\nresult, although Jishuken groups for suppliers came about in the 1970s, they were kept\n\"under wraps\" from external visitors and firms for almost twenty years.\nAlthough the analysis was limited to a taxonomy and subsequent prescriptive account of\nextended enterprise learning mechanisms, there was an undercurrent of focus upon\nevolutionary capability building. Sako demonstrated his understanding of the challenges\ninvolved in developing evolutionary capabilities.\nIndividual assistance is good whenever we are looking for quick\nresults...Jishuken is good for developing and training people, both\nat the suppliers and at Toyota...It would most certainly be quicker\nfor an expert [in OMCD] to take a lead and provide answers [to a\nsupplier], but this would not result in developing the skills of those\nwho are led. The strength of the Toyota Production System lies in\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\ncreating as many people who can implement and put into practice\nthe TPS on their own as possible. So the most important thing for\nthe survival of TPS is human resource development (Sako, 12).\nThis account was a vivid metaphor to the need for pursuing multiple capability\nenhancement, or \"taishitsu kyoka\" - \"the strengthening of one's constitution\" - across\nmultiple levels: individuals, groups, and firms.\nBowen and Spear described Toyota's learning processes in \"DNA of the Toyota\nProduction System.\" Spear clarified the explanation of how Toyota embeds learning\nexperiments and evolutionary improvement capability through four rules:\nThe pathway rule states:\nSpecify who will get what product, service, or information from whom over a\nsimple pathway. Test this refutable hypothesis by asking, 'Was the actual\nsupplier the expected supplier?' If the customer's need was met by an\nunexpected supplier, then the pathway was under designed; too few resources\nwere committed. Conversely, if an expected supplier was not needed, then too\nmany resources were committed to the pathway.\nThe connection rule states:\nSpecify how each customer will make 'unambiguous' requests that indicate what\nto deliver, when, and in what volume directly of an immediate supplier, and\nspecify how each supplier will make responses directly to his or her immediate\ncustomers. Test this refutable hypothesis by asking, 'Was the actual response\nthe expected response?' If the supplier fell behind and orders accumulated, then\ncustomer need was underestimated or the supplier capability was overestimated.\nConversely, if the supplier produced and delivered ahead of actual customer\nneed, then the customer need was overestimated or the supplier capability was\nunderestimated.\nThe activity rule states:\nSpecify each activity's work-element content, sequence, timing, location, and\noutcome. Test this refutable hypothesis by asking, 'Was the actual activity\nperformed as designed, generating the expected outcome?' If the work was not\nperformed as designed, then something about the worker's preparation caused\nhim or her to fail. If the work was done as designed, but an inadequate outcome\nresulted, then the design itself was inadequate.\nThe improvement rule states:\nSpecify that the smallest group affected by a problem (i.e., the activity doer or\nthe connection or pathway users) is responsible for its immediate resolution.\nSpecify a qualified teacher to help in problem solving work. Specify that\nproblems be solved by constructing bona fide, hypothesis testing experiments.\nSpecify that improvement continue in the direction of ideal production and\ndelivery. Test that problems are resolved by the affected individual or group as\nexperiments by asking 'Are problems being recognized and 'counter-measured'\nwhen and where they occur by the people affected by the problem?' If not, then\nreadjust the scope and scale of hierarchical responsibility to match better the\nactual nature and frequency with which problems are actually occurring.\nIndividuals can be trained and groups can be re-formed based on updated\nexpectations of the nature and frequency of problems. (Spear C, 20-21)\n\nThe pathway, connection, activity, and improvement rules are ingrained in Toyota's\npeople and processes. The combination of clear specifications with frequent, self-\ndiagnostic tests creates the organizational space for emergent improvement.\nFigure 2.6.7 Rules-in-use for building self-diagnostic, adaptive systems (Spear C,19)\n2.7 Historical Taxonomies\nThe most useful reference in the historical taxonomies category was Takahiro Fujimoto's\nEvolution of a Manufacturing System at Toyota. It was a vivid description of both the\ncurrent state of Toyota's lean enterprise as well as its evolution since Toyota's formation.\nI found Fujimoto's definition of the Toyota Production System to be appropriately scoped\nand specific. The author defined TPS as a \"dense, regular, and accurate transmission of\nvalue-carrying information between flexible (information-redundant) information assets.\nThe system for higher productivity and shorter throughput time is designed from the\ninformation receiver side, while the system for higher conformance quality is designed\nfrom the information source side\" (Fujimoto, 125).\nSimilar to Sako's emphasis, Fujimoto focused on two primary capabilities of TPS: the\nability to continuously improve productivity/throughput time and quality. The dense\ninformation network that supported TPS capabilities resulted in improved productivity\nand throughput time. This included a variety of techniques, including JIT, black box\nparts, andon line stops, multi-skilled workers with flexible task assignments (shojinka),\nand levelization across production volume and mix (heijunka).\nFigure 2.7.1 Dense information transmission improves throughput capability (Fujimoto, 111)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nThe transmission of accurate information throughout the network supported Toyota's\nquality capability. This information system was enhanced by supplier kaizen,\nmaintenance of process information through TPM and standard work, and fast feedback\nof defect information.\nFigure 2.7.2 Accurate information transmission improves quality capability (Fujimoto,113)\nThe text distinguished between what most western adherents to TPS think the system\nrepresents versus the evolution and causal sources of the system. Fujimoto identified\nseveral important techniques of TPS and illustrated how they emerged through Toyota's\nevolution. The breadth and depth of the analysis is illustrated below.\nTable 2.7.3 Evolutionary development paths of TPS subsystems (Fujimoto, 76).\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nThis important distinction, between TPS and a static view of \"best practice\" is an\nextremely important fact for every lean practitioner. Although many techniques of lean\nare applicable to all firms, they must be chosen, initialized, institutionalized, and evolved\nso that firms can build these into sustainable competitive advantages. The techniques\nknown as TPS by most western observers are already substantially dated. Most firms,\nboth east and west, need to cross an increasingly vast chasm to gain competitive parity\nwith lean enterprises like Toyota.\nAlthough Fujimoto was similar to Sako in holding an evolutionary mental model, he\ndisagreed with Sako on the reliance upon notions of tacit knowledge sharing as a key\ndifferentiator of lean extended enterprises.\n\"the most organic version...is to a large extent standardized,\narticulated, and functionally transparent...We should not rely\nentirely on this logic [of tacit knowledge] when analyzing\nmanufacturing routines of a modern mass-production system, be it\nToyota's or Ford's\" (Fujimoto 124).\nNishiguchi's Strategic Industrial Sourcing provided another superb example of Japanese\nindustrial evolution with particular emphasis on supplier relationships. His insights\nquickly ended the monolithic cultural assumptions behind Japanese extended enterprise\ncapabilities, as well as the transaction cost views assumptions behind related assets. He\nrelied heavily upon historical and structural constraints to explain industrial development.\nHe also developed the \"Aisin Fire\" case study to demonstrate the substantial power of\nToyota's lean extended enterprise subnetworks to problem solve and learn.\nThere is also a rich field of historical taxonomies in the field of Japanese keiretsu. Most\nof these originated from the late 1980's through the mid 1990's. They mostly focused on\nthe basic classification and taxonomy of the Japanese keiretsu. The more insightful\naccounts distinguish between \"horizontal/capital keiretsu\" and \"vertical/production\nkeiretsu.\" The seminal work on the Japanese keiretsu was Michael Gerlach's Alliance\nCapitalism: The Social Organization of Japanese Business.\nGerlach's account of the keiretsu detailed the transformation of pre-World War 2\nzaibatsu, or family based conglomerates, into post-World War 2 vertical keiretsu. He\nidentified several horizontal keiretsu techniques, includes cross-shareholding and senior\nmanagement meetings.\nAnother sample of the taxonomy of Japanese keiretsu is Miyashita and Russell's\nKeiretsu: Inside the Hidden Japanese Conglomerates. This account also made the\ndistinction between horizontal and vertical keiretsu.\nInterestingly, the keiretsu taxonomies relied heavily on two primary sources. These were\nannual reviews by two organizations: Dodwell Marketing Consultants and \"kenyo\nkeiretsu\". They primarily tracked inter-company shareholding and senior management\nmeetings as indicators of keiretsu membership. These reports were primarily logistical\nand did not delve into the significance or evolution of the networks involved.\n\nThe most dynamic taxonomy of the Japanese keiretsu was Richter's Strategic Networks:\nThe Art of Japanese Interfirm Cooperation. This account expanded slightly upon these\ntypes of business networks, notably between capital keiretsu, production keiretsu, and\ntrans-keiretsu. Primary examples of capital keiretsu were Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo,\nFuyo, Sanwa, and Dai-ichi Kangyo. Primary examples of production keiretsu were\nToyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors, Hitachi, and Fujitsu. Primary examples of trans-\nkeiretsu included R&D consortia or bilateral alliances with western firms. It also\ndiscussed knowledge creation, driving forces behind strategic networks and their\nevolution. Richter argued that Japanese alliances are evolving from semi-closed to\npermeable networks, as illustrated below.\nFigure 2.7.4 Japanese keiretsu are emerging as permeable networks (Richter, 93)\nLincoln and Ahmadjian follow in this taxonomic keiretsu tradition. Similar to Richter's\nview of evolving keiretsu relationships, they found Toyota was simultaneously\ninternalizing its relationships with Daihatsu and Hino while moving towards more open\nnetworks for standardized parts. Other traditionally openly networked industries like\nconsumer electronics were moving toward permeable and closed networks. As keiretsu\nrelationships move to permeable networks, the strategic advantage for lean extended\nenterprises like Toyota will be the ability to \"effectively restructure its alliances when\ncircumstances warrant\" (Ahmadjian & Lincoln, 698)\n2.8 Massachusetts Institute of Technology resources\nSeveral Leaders For Manufacturing students in the class of 2003 were instrumental in the\nco-evolution of thinking on lean enterprises. These included Brian Bowers, Ted\nPiepenbrock, and Lou Rassey. We were approaching the prospect of extended\nenterprises from a variety of directions. The intellectual and practical challenges\nprovided by lean extended enterprises are great. Only through meaningful intellectual\ndiscussion will we expand our understanding of these complex phenomena.\nTed Piepenbrock and Brian Bowers began looking at Fine's \"Five Cogs\" for a\nTechnology Roadmapping class. They developed the \"telephone pole\" symbol below to\nrepresent the cascading relationship of these different dynamics for the aerospace\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nindustry. For instance, regulatory and government policy dynamics shifted from a\nvertical functional emphasis of \"higher, faster, farther\" to a horizontal program emphasis\non \"better, faster, cheaper.\" This cascaded down through bullwhip dynamics,\ndisintegration across several value chains, an implied change in corporate strategy\ntowards building enterprise management capabilities, and refocusing attention towards\ndifferent dimensions of technology dynamics.\n\nFigure 2.8.1 \"Telephone pole\" of roadmapping five dynamics (Piepenbrock/Bowers, 6)\nThe four of us have been building upon this initial analysis to further our understanding\nof architecting lean enterprises.\n\nThe conversation around lean enterprises also proceeded in the Lean Aerospace Initiative\n(LAI) at M.I.T. Debbie Nightingale and Kirk Bozdogan were strong contributors to this\nprocess. The LAI consortium started defining the principles and processes of lean\nenterprises. This process began with the development of the Lean Enterprise Model\n(LEM) and was followed by the creation of the Lean Enterprise Self Assessment Tool\n(LESAT) with the Transition-to-Lean (TTL) Roadmap.\n\nFigure 2.8.2 Transition-to-Lean (TTL) Roadmap\n\nDeborah Nightingale (c) 2000 Massachusetts Institute of\nT\nh\nl\nEntry/Re-entry\nCycle\nFocus on the Value\nStream\nInitial\nLean\nVision\nShort Term Cycle\nCreate & Refine\nTransformation Plan\nLean\nTransformation\nFramework\nAdopt Lean\nParadigm\nEnterprise\nStrategic\nPlanning\nFocus on Continuous\nImprovement\nOutcomes on\nEnterprise\nMetrics\nImplement Lean Initiatives\nEnterprise\nLevel\nTransformation\nPlan\nDevelop Lean Structure &\nBehavior\nDetailed\nLean\nVision\nEnvironmental\nCorrective\nAction Indicators\nDetailed\nCorrective Action\nIndicators\nDecision to\nPursue\nEnterprise\nTransformation\n-Build Vision\n-Convey Urgency\n-Foster Lean Learning\n-Make the Commitment\n-Obtain Senior Mgmt.\nBuy-in\n-Map Value Stream\n-Internalize Vision\n-Set Goals & Metrics\n-Identify & Involve Key\nStakeholders\n-Organize for Lean Implementation\n-Identify & Empower Change Agents\n-Align Incentives\n-Adapt Structure & Systems\n-Identify & Prioritize Activities\n-Commit Resources\n-Provide Education & Training\n-Monitor Lean Progress\n-Nurture the Process\n-Refine the Plan\n-Capture & Adopt New Knowledge\n-Develop Detailed Plans\n-Implement Lean Activities\nEnterprise Level Roadmap\n+\n+\nLong Term Cycle\nDeborah Nightingale (c) 2000 Massachusetts Institute of\nT\nh\nl\nGovernment / Regulatory Policy\nDynamics\nBusiness Cycle\nDynamics\nIndustry Structure\nDynamics\nTechnology\nDynamics\nCorporate Strategy\nDynamics\n\nMurman et al. built on LAI's theoretical base and clarified the tasks involved in three key\nareas: identifying, proposing, and delivering value to a balanced set of stakeholders for\nthe enterprise. The stakeholder view of the enterprise was a dominant mental model for\nthis set of ideas.\nThe lean enterprise was defined as \"an integrated entity that efficiently creates value for\nits multiple stakeholders by employing lean principles and practices\" (Murman et al.,\n144). The work began flushing out the variety of Life Cycle, Enabling Infrastructure, and\nEnterprise Leadership processes that support lean enterprises. In addition to describing\nthe principle and process architecture of lean enterprises, LAI stressed the cross-\nstakeholder nature of lean enterprises and the need to look beyond individual firm\nboundaries. This is particularly important across multiple programs.\nLife Cycle Processes\n-\nBusiness Acquisition and Program Management\n-\nRequirements Definition\n-\nProduct/Process Development\n-\nSupply Chain Management\n-\nProduction\n-\nDistribution and Support\nEnabling Infrastructure Processes\n-\nFinance\n-\nInformation Technology\n-\nHuman Resources\n-\nQuality Assurance\n-\nFacilities and Services\n-\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety\nEnterprise Leadership Processes\n-\nStrategic Planning\n-\nBusiness Models\n-\nManaging Business Growth\n-\nStrategic Partnering\n-\nOrganizational Structure and Integration\n-\nTransformation Management\nFigure 2.8.3 Multi-program enterprise process architecture (Murman et al., 145)\nI relied on six previous Leaders For Manufacturing and System Design Management\ntheses for insight on my project. The project followed in Emmanuel Gillio's work, which\nI learned from and built upon. Gillio implemented heijunka processes at Kodak. The\nheijunka process was subsequently institutionalized, improved, and extended to other\nbusiness units and value streams. The business unit my project focused on implemented\nthe heijunka process in its operations five months prior to my arrival.\nI benefited from previous Eastman Kodak Co. theses as well. Sridhar Sadasivan's thesis\n\"Clockspeed Boundary Modularity: A Novel Approach to Architect Digital Cinema\nSystem\" was a terrific introduction to potential mitigation techniques for technology\ndynamics with Fine's \"Five Cogs.\" The concept of boundary modularity provides a very\ninteresting analogue to other ideas I developed in my thesis. Matthew Street's thesis,\n\"Quick Response Inventory Replenishment for a Photographic Material Supplier,\"\nprovided a rich basis to build my insights on implementation and organizational\nchallenges of a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) program. Esther Wong's thesis\n\"Reducing Demand Variability by Improving Information and Material Flows\" provided\ninsights to partition the challenge into material and information flows.\n\nChapter 3: Project Analysis\n3.1 Problem Statement\nThe current economic and market changes facing Eastman Kodak Co. are increasingly\nimportant to understand operational and strategic priorities. The goal of the internship\nwas to assist extension of lean efforts from the manufacturing function at Eastman Kodak\nCo. vertically to other functions within the company as well as horizontally across firms.\nThe task involved maintaining Kodak's lean manufacturing systems and deepening our\nunderstanding of the lean enterprise in order to extend its scope. As a result, the business\nunit would improve its profitability and the Kodak Operating System office would be in\nan improved position to deepen efforts at extending the lean enterprise into other areas.\n3.2 Situation/Background\nGlobalization and technological change are forcing firms in virtually every industry to\nradically change the way they do business. Eastman Kodak Co. is a world class company\nthat is finding the need to manage its businesses differently overall - to develop a lean\nenterprise. The silos of different functional groups - manufacturing, supply chain, sales,\nand distribution - within many firms are fairly deep. However, functional segregation\nalso occurs across organizations. The result of both horizontal and vertical silos result in\nsignificantly higher costs to maintain service levels.\nThere are a variety of mitigation techniques to introduce in order to combat silos\nthroughout the enterprise. These include a wide variety of supply chain techniques, like\nEfficient Consumer Response (ECR), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), Collaborative\nPlanning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR). These techniques improve material\nand information flows, thus reducing cycle times and allowing for inventory reductions.\nHowever, a fundamental component of lean enterprises neglected by these techniques is\nthe relationship between firms themselves. Many firms believe competition only acts at\nthe level of the individual firm. However, in business, as in nature, evolutionary\nprocesses act at multiple levels of the evolutionary hierarchy. Routines, functions, firms,\nindividual alliances, and production networks are all evolutionary \"individuals.\"\n3.2.1 Approach\nThe work performed during the project is described by the following:\n1. Operational evaluation of alternative distribution scenarios\n2. Financial analyses of scenarios\n3. Vendor Managed Inventory\n4. Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment with customers\n5. Preparation of low volume/high mix production control system\n6. Engineering and production layouts for new material flows\n7. Thorough literature review on theory behind value creation/delivery/capture of\norganizational alliances and evolution\n\n3.2.2 Summary of Findings\nThe results from the project that benefited Eastman Kodak Co. were:\n- Identified business case for greater than $2 million Net Present Value project\n- Helped train executive management in lean enterprise techniques\n- Improved vertical functional communication\n- Initiated and maintained horizontal functional communication\n- Trained implementation team and prepared key materials\nThe conclusions and key lessons learned are:\n- Technical modeling and simulation should be components of an organizational\nstrategy for implementation.\n- Strategic alliances, and particularly strategic production networks, can be a\nprimary powerful source of competitive advantage, or \"collaborative advantage.\"\n- Managers need to understand the evolution of the firm, and importantly the lean\nenterprise, in order to focus their efforts.\n3.3 Current value stream map\nThe interesting aspect of Eastman Kodak Co.'s value stream is its length. It is difficult\nfor individuals to gain a comprehensive view of the value stream due to limitations of\nexperience. This was a particularly important constraint for the author as a newcomer to\nthe organization. In this respect, the aid of the Kodak Operating System office and the\nbusiness unit's Supply Chain group was particularly important.\nOne of the first tasks in attacking waste in the enterprise was mapping the value stream.\nThis task included two aspects: establishing a basic understanding of the supply chain for\nthe entire business unit, and then choosing a value stream to focus on.\nIn order to get a comprehensive understanding of the supply chain, the author created a\n\"Worldwide KOS Supply Chain Map\" for the business unit in question. This map\nworked across value streams and locations to provide a basic understanding of material\nflows across the enterprise. For confidentiality reasons, this map is not included.\nAfter understanding the basic material flows across value streams, the author was in a\nbetter position to choose a high leverage value stream for analysis and action. Although\nthe author cannot disclose the specific business unit or product lines the value stream\ncovered, a simplified view of the value stream process is illustrated.\nTo understand the supply chain, some basic concepts in film manufacturing need to be\nunderstood. The following few definitions will be useful:\nSupport: the tangible, thickest portion of the film upon which all other layers are placed;\nalso called base. Two types of support are used: cellulose acetate and ESTAR.\nCellulose acetate: support material made from wood fibers.\nESTAR: support material made from petroleum.\n\nEmulsion: A photosensitive evenly distributed mixture of gelatin and salts that form the\nimaging layers on support.\nThe customers of the supply chain were fulfilled through a daily phone process. This\nphone call initiated a distribution fulfillment operation through paper forms and the Qwik\nlogistics system. This created the daily ship schedule that was fulfilled out of Kodak\nRDCs to their appropriate customers. The resulting pipeline inventory positions were\nused from DSM and SAP to create a daily heijunka pull signal from the supermarket at\nthe end of the finishing process. The use of heijunka at this stage in the value stream is\nvery different from traditional use of inventory and production in supply chains.\nTraditionally, production and the supply chain is made flexible to ensure guaranteed\nlevels of service against variable demand.\nFigure 3.3.1 Traditional view of inventory to stabilize downstream service (Chapman 24)\nHowever, the heijunka process attempts to level this demand variability and push the\nvariability into inventory. This process uses inventory to promote stability for all stages\nin the supply chain upstream of the pacemaker process that utilizes heijunka. This\ninsensitivity to the demand signal provides significant advantages, particularly for long\nsupply chains, to learn, improve operations and reduce their underlying cost structure.\nFigure 3.3.2 Lean view of inventory to stabilize upstream supply chain (Chapman 28)\nThese level volume and mix pulls generated production kanban requests. Production\nkanban accumulated to compensate for the lot size difference between two FIFO\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nconnected operations. Signal kanban created pulls of \"wide rolls,\" which are 6,000' to\n12,000' long and 54\" wide rolls of coated sensitized film. This film was subsequently slit\nfrom 54\" wide into the appropriate width for multiple slits, frequently 35mm wide. The\nslit rolls were then perforated and packaged appropriately for distribution. After the\n\"wide rolls\" have been pulled, replenishments were pulled from the \"wide roll\"\nsupermarket. This process combined with other value streams at the push-pull boundary\nto generate demand for the upstream processes. Coating was Kodak's primary\nmonument, requiring production planning, capacity planning, and production control to\nissue schedules to all upstream operations. These schedules changed daily yet allowed\nfor certain levels of coverage to cover cycle time and lead time differences. The coating\nprocess was initiating a level volume and mix schedule for the first time. This was a very\ndifficult process to undergo given the supply uncertainties involved upstream. The\nsolution, emulsion, dispersion, and gel operations all utilized push operations to supply\nmelting. Both acetate and ESTAR support operations still used push mechanisms to\nsupply coating.\nDistribution\nSupport\nSolution\nMfg/Test\nEmulsion\nMfg/Test\nDispersion\nMfg/Test\nSynthetic\nChemicals\nFinishing\nRegional\nDistribution\nCenter\nPull region\nPush region\nCustomer A\nCustomer B\nCustomer C\nSupply Chain\nItem Planning\nHeijunka, DSM, SAP\nKodak Business Unit\nRegional Sales\nDSM, SAP\nDaily\nDaily with\ncoverage\nProduction planning\nCapacity planning\nProduction Control\nSAP, OPAL, AMAPS\nDaily\nDaily\nDistribution\nFulfillment\nQwik & paper\nDaily Ship Schedule\nDaily phone\n& paper\nSlit\nPerf/\nPack\nDaily\nDaily\nDaily\nMetals\nPackaging\nVendors\nGel\nMelt /\nTest\nFIFO Coat\nFIFO\nFIFO\nFIFO\nFIFO\nPattern\nSequence\nManufacturing\nFigure 3.3.3 Current value stream\n\n3.4 Training simulation of current and future value streams\n\nAfter understanding the overall business unit material flows and selecting a value stream\nfor analysis, the author needed to help team members in the Kodak Operating System\noffice garner support to extend lean across Kodak's enterprise. Many corporations\nbelieve they have made the transition to lean simply by introducing pull processes.\nUnfortunately, without other TPS techniques like leveling demand and lean enterprise\ndistribution, the supply chain develops significant waste and is ultimately not sustainable.\nThe purpose of the simulation was to create a vivid portrayal of this enterprise instability\nthat is inherent in lean systems that lack the necessary downstream scope and stability.\nThe writer helped Earl Chapman develop and execute the simulation for Kodak senior\nmanagement. The audience included CEO Daniel Carp as well as the management of the\nbusiness unit that my analysis and future implementation would impact.\n\nThe simulation demonstrated Kodak's current state of the pull region of the supply chain.\nTherefore, the simulation represented all the processes at the push-pull boundary and\ndownstream. These processes included coating, finishing, central warehousing, regional\nwarehousing, and logistics links. It was generalized across business units so that each\ncould see the fundamental processes of the current state that affected their operations.\nThe simulation layout is illustrated below:\n\nFigure 3.4.1 Pull processes alone do not make a supply chain lean (Chapman 21)\n\nThe simulation was designed to mimic Kodak's actual processes. In order to maintain\nthe correct sequence of events, we broke the simulation into rounds. Each round\nconsisted of several steps:\nDemand generation\nDemand fulfillment from regional warehouses\nTransportation of material/information from central to regional warehouses\nTruck planning\nCentral warehousing\nInternal trucking between finishing and central warehouse\nFinishing\nInternal trucking from sensitizing to finishing\nSensitizing\nREGION 1\nWAREHOUS\nCustomers\nREGION 2\nWAREHOUS\nCustomers\nCENTRAL\nWAREHOUSE\nBlack/Grey\nFinishing\nWhite/Blue\nFinishing\nRed/Tan\nFinishing\nSensitizing\nRegion 1\nTruck Planning\nRegion 2\nTruck Planning\nMaterial flow\nInformation flow\n\nI will describe each of these steps to demonstrate how a current state in a \"lean\nproduction\" company can, in reality, be anything but \"lean.\"\n\nStep 1: Demand generation\n\nThe first step was demand generation. We created a product portfolio of six fictional\nproducts by color: gray, black, white, blue, red, and brown. The products were\nrepresented by Legosa in order to represent portions of larger upstream lot sizes, notably\n\"wide rolls\" in manufacturing and full trucks in logistics. Each regional distribution\ncenter was based on a real Kodak RDC. Simulated product demand was scaled down\nfrom real individual products at those real RDCs. The regions had unique portfolio\npatterns and demand biases.\n\nThe Demand for Region 1 is illustrated below:\n\nFigure 3.4.2 Region 1 demand (Chapman and White, 14)\n\nThe Demand for Region 2 is illustrated below:\n\nFigure 3.4.3 Region 2 demand (Chapman and White, 15)\n10 11 12 13 14 15\nDay\nDemand\nGray 16\nBlack 8\nWhite 16\nBlue 8\nRed 16\nTan 8\n10 11 12 13 14 15\nDay\nDemand\nGray 16\nBlack 8\nWhite 16\nBlue 8\nRed 16\nTan 8\n\nStep 2: Demand Fulfillment\nAt the RDCs, each individual product was attached to a kanban denoting its region and\nproduct type. After reviewing the round's new demand, the regional warehouse manager\nwas responsible to fulfill the demand. They did this by removing product of each type\nfrom their inventory and placing it in the appropriate fulfillment bucket. This action\n\"freed up\" kanbans for upstream replenishment. After placing these kanban in \"trucks\"\nfor return to the regional trucking planners, the regional warehouse managers replenished\ntheir inventories with the inventory waiting in trucks delivered the previous round. The\nreceiving capacity of the regional warehouses was finite due to labor and physical\nconstraints. This sometimes prevented receipt of the previous round's shipment.\nUnder the current state, regional warehouses frequently had \"lots of inventory, but none\nof the right product.\" This arose primarily from local optimization and supply delays of\nproduct mix upstream. When a stockout occurred, this represented lost revenues in a\nsaturated market and potentially lost points of market share. Therefore, the regional\nwarehouse managers were given noisemakers to alert other members of the supply chain\nwhen they had difficulty filling demand.\nThe pictures of both regional warehouses are below.\nFigure 3.4.4 Region 1 Warehouse\nFigure 3.4.5 Region 2 Warehouse\n\nStep 3: Transportation of material/information from central to each regional warehouses\nThe central warehouse allocated replenishment inventory for each regional warehouse the\nround before. In the previous step, each regional manager \"freed up\" replenishment\nrequest kanban when filling demand. At this round, transportation occurs in which\nplanned and released material flows downstream from the central warehouse to each\nregion and replenishment kanban information flows upstream from the regional\nwarehouses to trucking planners.\nStep 4: Truck planning\nAfter information for downstream inventory replenishment arrives from the regional\nwarehouses, this becomes information the trucking planners can use in this step. The\ntrucking planners have to manage one of the constraints fundamental to logistics as well\nas warehouse management: pursuing full truck utilization and reducing the number of\n\"picks\" in the warehouse. In order to gain decent utilization, truck planners would like to\n\"cube out\" their trucks. Similar to traditional manufacturing, these planners would like to\namortize their fixed \"setup costs\" for trucking across as much material as possible. This\nis analogous to maximizing the length of a production run for a particular machine setup.\nLikewise, managers in the central warehouse (or Central Distribution Center, CDC)\nwould like to maximize the number of \"picks\" in a particular location of the warehouse in\norder to improve worker productivity. This results in the planners promoting two crucial\nelements: extreme truck configurations (full or empty) with low relative productive mix\n(maximizing the amount of one product type). As a result, the regional warehouses are\nfrequently either overwhelmed or starved of replenishments, while the product mix\ncomes in \"slugs\" regardless of what is needed.\nThe truck planners were given an arrayed space to lay out their deck of replenishment\nkanban. Using these new kanban and any remaining from previous rounds, the truck\nplanner attempted to balance effective replenishments with functional pressures of pick\nminimization and full truck maximization.\nFigure 3.4.6 Truck planners were pressured to run \"full trucks\" (Chapman and White, 8)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nIf planners were unable to \"cube out\" a \"full truck,\" they would hold the cards for the\nnext round. This occurred frequently because the demand pattern did not provide enough\nconstant demand of individual items or sizes of items. Truck planners were sometimes\nprevented from sending trucks because of individual item shortages at the CDC.\nAfter the truck planners finished \"cubing out\" their trucks, they made picks from the\nwarehouse in preparation for the next round. The planners placed the products and their\nplanned kanban into trucks awaiting departure in the following round.\nIn order to bring visibility to the problems truck planners run into, they were given\ndifferent noisemakers to bring attention when they did not have enough material to fill a\ntruck for shipment or when they ran out of a particular product for replenishment.\nThe truck planning for each region is pictured below.\nFigure 3.4.7 Truck planning for each region\nStep 5: Central Warehousing\nFirst, the central warehouse manager collected the \"freed up\" kanban for finishing and\nplaced them in trucks. Second, the manager received inbound product and kanban from\nher receiving docks and placed them into storage.\nFigure 3.4.8 Central Warehouse\n\nStep 6: Internal trucking between finishing and the central warehouse\nThe internal trucking manager went on a milkrun using the \"freed up\" kanban from the\ncentral warehouse to pick up the appropriate material for the CDC. This material was\nsubsequently deposited at the central warehouse receiving dock.\nStep 7: Finishing\nFinishing managers accumulated the kanban \"freed up\" by the internal trucking manager\nto generate signaled pulls from upstream. Finishing was fundamentally a disassembly\nprocess, in which \"wide rolls\" or \"Master Rolls\" from coating were slit, perforated, and\npackaged. These three sub-operations were condensed in the simulation to one process\nfor simplicity since the processes were typically tightly connected with FIFO lanes. Due\nto lot size differences, finishing managers generally waited to slit a wide roll until there\nwas enough final demand to consume it. Therefore, the kanban from the central\nwarehouse needed to meet the appropriate number and mix for that particular product to\ngenerate a signal kanban instruction to pull a \"wide roll\" from inventory.\nAfter the signal kanban permitted a wide roll withdrawal, the wide roll was slit\n(disassembled) and prepared for shipment in the next round. This lot sizing problem\nfrequently left some demand from downstream unmet. In addition, finishing had capacity\ncontrols due to machine and labor constraints. Whenever a finishing line needed to use\novertime to fulfill demand or ran out of wide roll supply, they used their noisemaker.\nThe finishing operation is depicted below.\nFigure 3.4.9 Finishing\nStep 8: Internal trucking from sensitizing to finishing\nAfter finishing made their \"wide roll\" pulls from their supermarket, internal trucking\nreplenished finishing's inventories from the sensitizing inventory.\n\nStep 9: Sensitizing\nSensitizing was the process of combining dispersion, emulsion, solution, and gel onto a\nbase of support. Fundamentally, it is a chemically controlled assembly process.\nSensitizing is the first process upstream of the push-pull boundary. This occurs because\nsensitizing is the largest bottleneck in the production system, has the largest setup times,\nand requires a specific order in which product types are produced. As a result, sensitizing\nuses a predetermined sequence. Although the sequence is predetermined, the actual\nschedule is malleable, in the sense that the sensitizing planner can expand or contract the\nnumber of wide roll of a specific type before changeovers. Therefore, the schedule\nremained separated from final demand due to sequencing, but was able to be manipulated\nto alleviate supply emergencies. However, this frequently resulted in further schedule\ndelay and potentially aggravated supply shortages later in the simulation.\nThe picture of the sensitizing operation is below.\nFigure 3.4.10 Sensitizing\nThe resulting dynamics from the simulation were intriguing. Although pull production\ntechniques using kanban and Quick Response existed at virtually every stage in the\nsupply chain, it resulted in massive customer stockouts, lack of appropriate product at\nvarious stages, and extensive use of overtime. Even though the current state supply chain\nmanager \"did everything right,\" the supply chain still responded horribly. In the words of\none participant of the demonstration, it was \"a sin\" to operate with this level of waste.\nThe simulation illustrated the need to follow process kaizen with system kaizen. Waste\ncan be attacked within silos but it can't be eliminated there - the benefits can only be\ngained at the extended enterprise level through system kaizen. Lean cannot be\nconstrained to the factory floor. It must expand to every point a firm touches the value\nstream, from value creation to value delivery.\n\nThe root of the problems in the current state arose from local optimization at various\nstages in the supply chain. Individual functions maximized behavior favored by\nincentives, continued mental models of demand and supply patterns, and sometimes\nattempted to game the supply chain. For instance, trucking planners had localized\nincentives to only send \"full trucks\" of minimal product mix to the regional distribution\ncenters. This resulted in batching and amplification of the replenishment signal. As a\nresult, finishing and sensitizing had more difficulty matching large changes in demand.\nThis impacted the supply chain with delays, overtime, inventory, and missed shipments.\n\nTo compensate for these challenges, the future state was improved in two primary ways.\nFirst, a leveled signal was sent throughout the supply chain. Truck planning was replaced\nwith heijunka control dedicated to each regional warehouse. This allowed the central\nwarehouse to supply replenishments to the regional warehouses with level volume and\nmix. The heijunka process maintained truck utilization (\"full trucks\"), improved the\npredictability of logistics (e.g. four trucks per day), and reduced replenishment variability\nin volume and mix.\n\nSecond, upstream operations leveraged this stability to globally optimize their activities,\nconnections, and pathways. Each stage in the chain created level replenishment plans for\ntheir customer, clear ahead/behind visual controls, and standard work to leverage the\nincreased confidence in the signal. Upstream inventories and supermarkets were\ndrastically reduced due to improved synchronization across the supply chain.\n\nAs a result, the central warehouse functioned as a cross dock in which planned materials\ncame in simply as a collection point for leveled distribution. Similarly, finishing and\nsensitizing supermarkets were right sized for their supply lot size and leveled demand\nrequirements. Sensitizing schedules were leveraged to produce \"every part every day\"\ngiven the improved predictability and reduced demand variability amplification.\n\nNote that the same demand patterns were used for both current and future states.\n\nThe change in the nature of RDC inventories to be the primary buffers, heijunka leveling\nat truck planning, and upstream globally optimizations are illustrated below.\n\nFigure 3.4.11 Heijunka and standard work enabled global supply chain optimization\n\nREGION 1\nWAREHOUS\nCustomers\nREGION 2\nWAREHOUS\nCustomers\nCENTRAL\nWAREHOUSE\nBlack/Grey\nFinishing\nWhite/Blue\nFinishing\nRed/Tan\nFinishing\nSensitizing\nRegion 1\nTruck Planning\nRegion 2\nTruck Planning\nMaterial flow\nInformation flow\n\nOverall, four simple tools were implemented throughout the supply chain:\n- Level volume\n- Standard Mix (i.e. Level both by item and total)\n- Ahead/Behind visual controls\n- Standardized Work (i.e. visual guides)\nAs a result, the simulation drastically improved supply chain dynamics on key metrics\nincluding customer service, inventory, fleet size, and required manufacturing capacity.\nThe results are depicted below.\nMetric\nUnleveled\nLeveled\nChange\nCustomer\nSome\nNo backorders\n-100%\nService\nbackorders\nAverage RDC\nInventory\n90 Units\n76 Units\n-15%\nAverage CDC\nInventory\n47 Units\n16 Units\n-65%\nFleet size\nApprox 31\ntrucks\n28 trucks\n-10%\nMfg Capacity\n46 Units/Day @\n32 Units/Day\n-30%\nMax\nMax\nTable 3.4.1 Simulation results\nThis set of solutions works because it attacks one of the four types of complexity in\naxiomatic design of complex systems: periodic time-dependent complexity. Since\nproduction systems contain hierarchical flow, this time-dependent complexity drives both\nreal and imaginary complexity into upstream operations. Lee argued that periodicity\nshould be introduced to prevent these systems from developing chaotic behavior. In a\nsimilar manner, heijunka leveling of volume and mix establishes a form of periodicity to\nleverage reduction of real and imaginary complexity throughout the supply chain.\nDoes uncertainty\nchange with time?\ncomplexity\ncomplexity\nReal\ncomplexity\nImaginary\ncomplexity\nCombinatorial\ncomplexity\nPeriodic\ncomplexity\nfrom upstream standard work\nSource of supply\nchain complexity\nComplexity\nTime-independent\nTime-dependent\nSource of benefits\nMeasure of uncertainty in achieving FR\nFigure 3.4.12 Heijunka eliminates periodic complexity and liberates value from real and\nimaginary complexity (adapted from Lee, 3).\n\n3.5 Heijunka process description and challenges\nThe simulation provided insight into the difficulties of using selective TPS techniques\nlike pull within the supply chain without leveling and application to distribution.\nHowever, for the business unit I worked for, leveling was a fairly new phenomenon.\nIt had been applied to a relatively small portion of the product portfolio. Although this\nportion was originally selected to include the majority of volume for the business unit,\nthere were still many problems to be solved in the process. There were two basic\ninformation processes in heijunka: withdrawal and production.\n3.5.1 Withdrawal card process\nThe withdrawal process began with daily shipments from RDC finished goods inventory\nto customers. These shipments were aggregated electronically through DSM and SAP\nand triggered the addition of withdrawal cards to \"Box 1.\" This box was the leveling box\nwhere withdrawal cards authorized the replacement of finished goods inventory at\nspecified item and system takts. Items were divided into \"A\" items and \"B\" items, with\nthe highest volume \"A\" items at the top of the box. \"A\" items were high volume items\nthat were Made-To-Stock (MTS) at a specified daily takt. This takt was changed\nmonthly to accommodate expected macro changes in demand and seasonal pre-builds.\nThey were controlled with their \"ahead-behind limits.\" The ahead limit specified the\nmaximum inventory needed to absorb demand variation. If the ahead limit was reached,\nfinishing was getting ahead of demand and needed to obtain information to determine\nwhether the item takt should be reduced. The behind limit represented the minimum\ninventory needed to cover supply leadtime. If the behind limit was reached, finishing\nwas getting behind demand and needed to obtain information to determine whether the\nitem takt should be increased. \"B\" items were low-to-mid volume items that were Made-\nTo-Order (MTO). All \"B\" items were run together at a specified daily takt.\nEvery morning, there was a \"morning huddle\" consisting of the supply chain finished\nitem planner, manufacturing management, manufacturing representatives, maintenance,\nquality, and KOS representatives on the plant floor. This group determined the\nahead/behind health of items in Box 1. The group also analyzed previous daily\nproduction rates with expected system takts to identify macro issues. Maintenance,\nquality, and workforce issues were also discussed to understand impacts on the process.\n\"Box 2\" was the loading box representing leveled volume and mix of customer demand.\nThis box had a time schedule at which cards from all items were pulled. Box 2 was\ndesigned explicitly to represent customer demand - not production's capability to fulfill\ndemand. A separate production control mechanism, the \"Escalation Box,\" was used to\nidentify and trigger diagnosis of production problems. As problems arose, withdrawal\ncards were placed in the column representing the source of difficulty. This became a\nvisual Pareto chart of components and suppliers that hindered production and required\nself-correction.\n\nAfter cards were pulled from the finishing supermarket at the specified time, the pallets\nwere shipped to finished goods inventory at the appropriate RDC or CDC.\nFigure 3.5.1 Heijunka withdrawal card sequence (Mooney, 9)\n3.5.2 Production card process\nThe production card process flowed out of the withdrawal card process. As cards were\nshipped from the finishing supermarket to finished goods inventory at the appropriate\nRDC or CDC, production cards were freed. These freed cards were removed from the\npallet and placed into \"Box 3,\" or the Lot Box. The Lot Box was required between\noperations when the upstream manufacturing unit was greater than the downstream\nshipment unit. Production cards were placed in the Lot Box until there was enough for a\nproduction lot. When the lot size was reached for an item, the signal kanban was placed\nin \"Box 4,\" or the Production Sequence Box. These boxes structured the sequence of\nwork at the machine as well as provided ahead/behind controls. In finishing, Box 4 used\na vacuum tube with colored golf balls as signal kanban. This allowed the slitting\noperators to see the next type of \"wide roll\" that needed to be pulled from the upstream\nsupermarket. This \"wide roll\" was subsequently split, perforated, packaged, and\ncombined with a production card on each pallet. These pallets closed the production card\nloop in the finishing supermarket, awaiting pulls for distribution.\nThe production card process is illustrated below.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nMean of Total demand\nMonth\nNote: Sigma used for limits based on standard deviation.\nXBar of Total demand\nFigure 3.5.2 Heijunka production card sequence (Mooney, 9)\n3.5.3 Heijunka challenges\nThe demand process for the product portfolio was extremely erratic. The value stream\ncontained high demand variability: both total daily volume and individual product daily\nvolume had coefficients of variance (C.O.V.) greater than 1.5.\nMonthly system takts were based on average demand for all items in the value stream.\nHowever, the demand process was not in control. Variation of daily system volume in\neach month was extremely high. As a result, significant finished goods were needed to\nbuffer demand variability. The variation in volume for all items, including seasonal\nmonths, is illustrated below.\nAvg=4536208.64\nLCL\nUCL\nAll Items,\nDaily Volume\nSeasonal\nMonth\nFigure 3.5.3 All items daily volume was out of control for calculating system takt\nWorse patterns of demand variability were prevalent at the individual item level.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nMean of 1993534'\nMonth\nNote: Sigma used for limits based on standard deviation.\nXBar of 1993534'\n-2000000\n-1000000\nAvg=2263898.97\nLCL\nUCL\nIndividual Item,\nDaily Volume\nSeasonal\nMonth\nFigure 3.5.4 Individual item daily volume was out of control\nAs a result, it was very difficult to maintain the heijunka process for leveling both volume\nand mix. Leveling the total volume across items was moderately successful. The heavy\nline represents the heijunka planned system daily takt. The area chart represents the\nactual production volume. There were a variety of instances in which supply variability\nwas particularly strong over the eleven months of data, including international and\ndomestic plant loading, personnel, and quality issues.\nAll Items,\nDaily Volume\nDay\nFigure 3.5.5 System-level production scheduling was fairly close to system takt\nThe difficulty in heijunka is rooted at leveling the mix. This became evident at the\nproduct family level. As there are large demands for particular classes of items, local\noptimization for distribution, sales, and downstream operations placed extreme pressures\non finishing and sensitizing to be flexible. As a result, \"B\" items that went unchallenged\nin breaking the B items cumulative takt effectively disrupted leveling the \"A\" items. The\nresulting amplification upstream and chaos in supply supermarkets was difficult to plan\nand create contingency plans for. \"Wide roll\" supermarkets were under pressure to stay\nlarge and respond quickly for uncertain future demand in order to buffer these breaks in\nthe heijunka system. The resulting demand spikes from certain families of products are\nillustrated below.\n\nFigure 3.5.6\nFamilies of items,\nDaily Volume\nDay\nFamily-level production scheduling became interrupted\nAt the individual item level, it was even more difficult to manage these demand spikes\nthat were forced through the heijunka process. The result was spiraling variability in the\nloading process. As some items were allowed to break out of their takt, this effectively\ndenied production of another item's takt given technical and personnel capacity\nconstraints. Therefore, as time progressed, these production gaps needed to be filled with\nlarger batches and longer spans of time devoted to individual items. The resulting item-\nlevel difficulty is illustrated below.\nIndividual Items,\nDaily Volume\nDay\nFigure 3.5.7 Item-level production scheduling became erratic\nIn order to search for root causes, the author analyzed demand volume across the entire\nproduct portfolio. A pareto analysis of the contribution of individual items to the\nsystem's cumulative takt illustrated that approximately 60% of the volume was included\nin the \"A\" item process. The combination of five high volume \"B\" items together broke\nthe ability to control \"B\" item takt when strong demands coincided. Therefore, these\nitems were converted from Make-To-Order \"B\" items into Make-To-Stock \"A\" items.\nThis shift subsequently reduced demand amplification approximately 25% for the total\ndaily volume in this business unit's value stream.\n\nFigure 3.5.8 Pareto of item volumes highlighted items to include in leveling process\nTakt\n(volume/day)\nAfter negotiation with operations, supply chain, and distribution, the suggested items\nwere included in the daily heijunka process for leveling. The resulting leveling by mix\nimproved quickly. However, due to the extreme demand variability in the nature of the\nbusiness unit and manufacturing flexibility constraints, it was difficult to maintain certain\nheijunka requirements strictly. The application of heijunka creates vibrant debates within\nand between functions in order to determine the appropriate balance between inventory\navailability, flexibility in finishing, and upstream variability amplification. However,\nwithout using heijunka as a tool to uncover upstream opportunities, the assumption of\nlocal optimization would have continued unabated.\n\n3.6 Supply chain model\nA model was created to build an understanding of the potential benefits, tradeoffs, and\ncosts in expanding lean techniques from manufacturing into distribution. The fulfillment\nprocess was broken up between the sales, distribution, supply chain, and manufacturing\norganizations. This resulted in a poorly designed fulfillment process in which each\norganization tended to optimize the portion of the chain under their control. Sales\nattempted to maximize the inventory coverage of both finished goods at the regional\ndistribution centers and \"wide roll\" before finishing in order to guarantee a 100% service\nlevel. Distribution only shipped \"full trucks\" after queuing the appropriate materials for\nshipment. Supply chain attempted to retain sufficient safety stock within the entire value\nstream to guarantee sufficient service levels and lead times. Manufacturing desired a\nlevel signal and more lead time in order to reduce capacity and inventory requirements.\nAlthough each group had operational control over key decisions, the manufacturing\norganization was responsible for bottom line P&L costs, including inventory.\nThe executive simulation and heijunka challenges highlighted the need to cross these\norganizational boundaries in order to design and develop a lean enterprise. The process\nto develop a comprehensive model to understand the value stream's real supply chain\nopportunities lay in gathering information, building the model, and analyzing the results.\n3.6.1 Information collection\nThe process of gathering information was fairly important. The act of getting\ninformation required the author to travel internationally, have extended interaction across\na variety of functions, and build a network of stakeholders. It meant retrieving\ninformation from a variety of sources. For instance, the author worked with the supply\nchain group to gather lead time information for the product portfolio, distribution to\nestablish logistics lane rates, trucking configurations, and lead times, manufacturing to\ndetermine supply capacity, and warehousing to determine labor rates.\n3.6.2 Model construction\nFrom the literature review, there were a variety of supply chain and logistics techniques\nthat remained difficult to apply to the project. The model was originally configured as an\nInteger Program (IP), yet quickly became too large to manage for technical and\norganizational/political reasons. Therefore, the author developed an Excel model to\nfacilitate inclusion of different stakeholders' assumptions.\nThe decisions of the model focused around five areas. First, the design of the supply\nchain was considered. The current state of the supply chain utilized two echelons of\ninventory between the finishing operation and the customers' operations. These two\nechelons consisted of a regional distribution center and a customer owned and controlled\nlocal inventory. The design decision included whether to collapse these two echelons\ninto a single echelon directly at the customer sites.\n\nThe second element of the model included the locations and rationale for inventory. The\ncurrent state utilized inventory at two locations for different reasons: the customer site\nheld inventory for consumption and excessive demand variability; the Kodak regional\ndistribution center also held inventory for close, responsive, daily replenishment. In\naddition to these functions, the heijunka program in finishing used the RDC inventory as\nthe primary buffer between demand variability and supply, requiring a significant\ninventory. This particular business unit had a large proportion of customer-specific\nfinished goods that consisted of specialized packaging and film requirements. These\nconstraints limited the effectiveness of risk pooling the regional distribution centers.\nGiven these constraints, it was feasible to utilize inventory for several different means.\nFirst, finished goods inventory at the regional distribution center could continue to be\nused for close daily replenishment, minor risk pooling, and upstream heijunka buffering.\nFinished goods inventory at the customer site could continue to be utilized for\nconsumption and demand variability. Second, with a single echelon supply chain design,\nthe majority of inventory could be located downstream at the customers, upstream at\nKodak finishing, or a hybrid of the two. Locating the majority of inventory downstream\nat customers would allow the inventory to be used both as the sole source of\nreplenishment for customer operations and also as the primary buffer for Kodak's\nheijunka process. The benefit of this would be immediate and preferred access to Kodak\nfinished goods while the disadvantage would be loss of minor risk pooling. Locating the\nmajority of inventory upstream at Kodak finishing would allow the inventory to be used\nboth as the sole source of replenishment for customer operations and also as the primary\nbuffer for Kodak's heijunka process. The advantage of this rationale for inventory would\nbe tighter connection with the Kodak finishing process and improved minor risk pooling\nwhile the difficulty would lie in maintaining a 100% replenishment service level. Using\na hybrid inventory model would entail the benefits of immediate availability while\npotentially jeopardizing replenishment capability at customer sites. This would occur by\nfilling too much of customers' receiving space by the wrong portfolio of items.\nThe third decision the model needed to address was the logistics design: how to configure\nthe logistics lanes. Three possibilities were modeled: indirect shipping, direct shipping,\nand milk runs. The current state used indirect shipping of trucks from Kodak finishing to\nregional distribution centers to customers. Direct shipping could be used to ship from\nKodak finishing directly to individual customers. Milk runs could be utilized to ship\nfrom Kodak finishing to multiple customers per run. The direct shipping and milk run\nscenarios entailed very different lane configurations, carriers, and cost structures.\nThe fourth segment modeled the truck utilization decision: whether to use full or \"less\nthan full\" trucks. This decision had substantial impacts upon the cost structure of\nlogistics and the product mix that could be accommodated. Full trucks could be used to\nmake shipments with a less precise customer item mix while entailing a lower logistics\ncost. However, this decision entailed other distribution and production tradeoffs,\nimpacting inventory and other variables throughout the supply chain.\nThe fifth and final section represented the nature of the delivery process. This delivery\nprocess could be either flexible or level. Flexible delivery processes had the advantage of\n\nbeing directly responsive to final customer demand yet suffered from logistics capacity\nconstraints and increased logistics costs. Leveled logistics reduced volume sensitivity to\ndownstream requirements by limiting absolute volumes while improving mix sensitivity\nby enabling a \"ship every part every day\" tactic. This tactic had the advantage of\navoiding additional logistics and supply chain costs.\nThe five basic decisions the model needed to address coupled together into scenarios. In\nthe following single echelon models, the decision to locate primary buffering inventory\nupstream at Kodak finishing required \"less than full\" trucks on a frequent basis to\nreplenish customers. Customers in these scenarios lacked safety stock and therefore\nneeded more frequent and precise fulfillment. In contrast, the decision to locate primary\nbuffering inventories downstream at customer sites required full trucks. The logistics\ncosts of frequent \"less than full\" trucks were substantial, thus requiring the coupling of\nfull trucks to fulfill to primary downstream inventories.\nFour distinct scenarios to the current state emerged. First, the primary buffering\ninventory could be located upstream at Kodak finishing. This enabled direct shipments\nwith \"less than full\" trucks to replenish customers. Second, the primary buffering\ninventories could be located downstream at customers. This required direct shipments\nwith full trucks to replenish individual customers. Third, the primary buffering inventory\ncould be located upstream at Kodak finishing. This enabled milk runs with \"less than\nfull\" trucks to replenish customers. Fourth, the primary buffering inventories could be\nlocated downstream at customers. This required milk runs with full trucks to replenish\nindividual customers. These four alternative scenarios from the current state value\nstream are illustrated below.\nLane\nconfiguration\nInventory\nplacement\nVisual Description\nDirect ship\nUpstream\n(Kodak finishing)\nLess than full\nLess than full\nLess than full\nLess than full\nFull\nFull\nFull\nFull\nDownstream\n(Customer)\nMilk run\nUpstream\n(Kodak finishing)\nDownstream\n(Customer)\nFigure 3.6.1 Alternate distribution scenarios to the current state\nThe structure of the model was designed to support analysis of the current state and these\nfour scenarios. The structure is partitioned into several sections: items, time, demand,\nsupply, inventory, cost, and project valuation.\n\nFirst, the product portfolio was scoped and selected. Products were chosen based on their\nprevalence in the overall business unit value stream and their relevance to potential pilot\ncustomers. Packaging and shipping configurations modeled manufacturing and\ndistribution requirements.\nSecond, the model's time boundaries were established. Data needed to be current yet\nhave enough historical depth to mitigate noise of new product introductions.\nThird, demand data needed to be gathered and tested to ensure quality input to the model.\nOrder history was initially gathered from an internal manufacturing system and later\nexpanded and verified by SAP. Units needed to be normalized for inclusion in the\nmodel. The demand data was used appropriately in each scenario to determine partial\ntruck and full truck shipments, the effect of these shipments on inventory in different\nscenarios, and the allocation of individual items to shipments.\nFourth, a supply schedule was created for manufacturing and distribution from demand\nand inventory data in each scenario. Supply scheduling required normalizing these data\nsets for proper units. Lead time, capacity constraints, supply logistics, and lack of\nsynchronization across the supply chain were also modeled.\nFifth, inventory levels at different locations were modeled. Each scenario used a\ndifferent combination of demand, supply, logistics, and inventory locations to determine\nthe appropriate levels. These were calculated with storage capacity, lead time, and\ntransportation constraints.\nSixth, cost information was gathered and explicitly included for inventory, transportation,\nand warehousing. Manufacturing costs were excluded because the heijunka process\ndecoupled upstream from distribution variation.\nSeventh, the scenarios were valued in order to determine the optimal path forward.\nStandard financial project management calculations were used on the outputs from the\nmodel, notably the transportation, warehousing, and inventory costs, to generate free cash\nflows relative to the baseline scenario. These free cash flows were then used to provide\nthe net present value (NPV) of each project. Projects with positive NPVs were\nconsidered worthwhile projects.\nAppendix A contains detailed formulas for each section of the model.\n\n3.6.3 Model analysis\nThe financial analysis that accompanied the operational model focused on the cost\nimplications of each scenario. Although some of these scenarios could have impacted\nrevenues, these effects were not as salient as the cost implications of the different tactical\nchoices. The original analysis indicated the dominant solution was to placing the primary\ninventory and pacemaker as far downstream in the value stream as possible. This\nallowed \"standard level mix\" trucks to transport finished goods from Kodak finishing to\ncustomer sites. It also provided the customer with immediate access to the vast majority\nof inventory for their consumption under Vendor Managed Inventory. The analysis used\nthe current state as the baseline cost against which all other scenarios were compared.\nAll the projects had positive NPVs, although those with downstream primary inventories\nwere prominent. The following NPVs are relative to the highest NPV project: Direct\nshipping with inventory downstream and expansion at the customer site.\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nDIRECT:\nFinishing -->\ncustomer\nwith\ninventory at\nFinishing\nDIRECT:\nFinishing -->\ncustomer\nwith\nHYBRID\ninventory\nDIRECT:\nFinishing -->\ncustomer\nwith\ninventory at\ncustomer &\nexpansion\nDIRECT:\nFinishing -->\ncustomer\nwith\ninventory at\ncustomer &\ntrucks\nMilkrun with\ninventory at\nfinishing\nMilkrun with\ninventory at\ncustomers\n& expansion\nMilkrun with\ninventory at\ncustomers\n& trucks\nProject\nRelative NPV (% of maximum NPV $)\nFigure 3.6.2 Relative initial NPVs favored direct shipping with inventory at customer\nHowever, after presenting these findings to other stakeholders, the author soon needed to\nbuild substantially more assumptions into the analysis. Intra-month demand variability\ncombined with the insensitive steady supply from the heijunka process created large\nswings in finished goods inventory. This finished goods inventory variability needed to\nbe accommodated with storage capacity. Unfortunately, both Kodak's finishing and\ndifferent customers' receiving capacities were too constraining for this level of inventory\nfluctuation. As a result, further details of building costs, marginal taxes, external storage\nin trailers and a variety of other options were researched. The resulting extension of the\nmodel confirmed the positive aspect of each of these scenarios over the baseline.\nHowever, it became apparent that the only short term feasible scenario was the hybrid\ndirect shipping single echelon model. It was sub-optimal yet still financially positive.\nThe distribution of final NPVs are distributed below.\n\nPhysical constraints\nat individual sites\nFigure 3.6.3 Hybrid scenario had highest feasible NPV\nAlthough the NPV for the hybrid scenario was positive, the author needed to further\nanalyze the business case in order to determine its validity. The transition to a business\ncase had prevented the success of a previous LFM implementation in Quick Response.\nThe author was determined to better understand the business case in order to prevent\nfuture dissolution after implementation. The resulting business case is normalized and\ndetailed in Appendix B.\n3.7 Value Stream Future State Map\nAfter completing the operational model, analysis, and business case, the future state value\nstream was mapped. The future state combined direct \"full truck\" shipping and\nreplenishment to each customer, hybrid storage at both Kodak finishing and customer\nsites, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Collaborative Planning Forecasting and\nReplenishment (CPFR). These changes only affected operations downstream of the\npush-pull boundary. The regional distribution center was eliminated and bypassed.\nShipments between Kodak finishing and the regional distribution center were eliminated\nas well as shipment between the RDC and customers. Inventory shifted to reside close to\nvalue-adding operations. Since the majority of hybrid inventory needed to be located\nafter Kodak finishing for constraint reasons, this became the location of the pacemaker in\nthe value stream. Daily consumption and rolling forecasts were communicated directly\nto a distribution fulfillment team. This team coordinated pulls and shipments to balance\nlevel shipments, local inventories at customers, and logistics costs. The heijunka process\nwas maintained in order to decouple upstream from unleveled distribution patterns. The\nfuture state of the value stream is illustrated below:\n\nDistribution\nSupport\nSolution\nMfg/Test\nEmulsion\nMfg/Test\nDispersion\nMfg/Test\nSynthetic\nChemicals\nFinishing\nPull region\nPush region\nSupply Chain\nItem Planning\nHeijunka, DSM, SAP\nDaily\nDaily with\ncoverage\nProduction planning\nProduction Control\nSAP, OPAL, AMAPS\nDaily\nDaily\nSlit\nPerf/\nPack\nMetals\nPackaging\nVendors\nGel\nMelt /\nTest\nFIFO Coat\nFIFO\nFIFO\nFIFO\nFIFO\nPattern\nSequence\nCustomer A\nCustomer B\nCustomer C\nDaily: consumption\n& rolling forecast\nDaily: consumption\n& rolling forecast\nDistribution\nFulfillment\nRolling schedule\nDaily\nDaily: consumption\n& rolling forecast\nManufacturing\nCapacity planning\nFigure 3.7.1 Future state of value stream\n3.8 Implementation\nAs the analysis got more specific, the constraints for the implementation began to\nemerge. These constraints needed to be discovered, contingency plans needed to be\nmade, and the team needed to be prepared for the implementation.\n3.8.1 Constraint discovery\nThe operational model brought a central dilemma to the fore: since this value streams\ncalculated heijunka takts on monthly forecasts, any exceptions or unplanned deviations\nfrom that forecast immediately affected finished goods inventory. This occurred\nfrequently and with large volumes for this business unit. As a result, the hybrid scenario\nneeded to have sufficient storage capacity for the maximum amount of finished goods to\ncover this intra-forecast variability. In the case of Kodak finishing for this business unit\nand our customers, the existing capacity was not sufficient.\n3.8.2 Constraint mitigation\nThe constraints could be mitigated, however, through several methods. First, Kodak\nneeded to increase the density of its inventory storage in order to absorb the capacity\nfrom the warehouse. This could be accomplished several ways, including modifying the\nproduction floor layout if enough room is available, negotiating for more room in\nadjacent areas on site, externally storing inventory at the closest distribution center,\nexternally storing inventory in trucks, externally storing inventory at a 3PL, and using\ndevices within the constraints with minor modifications to the current plant floor.\n\nMost of these options slowly were discounted as viable with improved information.\nThere was not enough room in the production line's current footprint, even with\nmodifications to the layout, to facilitate the inventory capacity. The only production\nspace available that was adjacent to the site was one or two floors above the site with\nextensive time required for material handling. The closest distribution center was the\nCentral Distribution Center (CDC), which would impose even worse lead times and\nduplicate much of the waste in the current state of warehousing and truck planning.\nExternally storing inventory in trucks incurred prohibitive costs to the distribution\nsystem. Storing inventory at a 3PL increased our lead times substantially more than the\nbusiness unit felt acceptable for the given customer base. This left the author to search\nfor devices that let us accept the constraints and use minor modifications to the current\nplant floor.\nAlthough several options were available, including Automated Storage and Retrieval\nSystems (ASRS), the KOS team was determined not to implement any monuments into\nthe production system. Therefore, the team planned to purchase and install gravity-fed\npallet flow conveyors. This would reduce the footprint of the inventory for forklift lanes\nwhile providing a non-powered FIFO lane. It also required minor modification to the\nlayout in finishing. See the illustrations below.\nFigure 3.8.1 Gravity-fed pallet flow conveyors\nTo support the use of these gravity-fed pallet flow conveyors, the author prepared the\nnew layout for finishing. This included testing feasibility of the equipment with the\nphysical dimensions of the building and the full portfolio of product packaging, obtaining\npermits for fire and safety, and estimating the new material flows. Finishing used \"water\nspiders,\" or \"water striders\" (mizusumashi) - workers who performed a wide range of\ntasks to enable other workers to perform a greater content of value added work. This is a\nway of creating more dense value adding flow and creating the potential to systematize\nimprovements within and outside the flow. Frequently water spiders bring materials to\nthe finishing line in specified quantities on specified routes, thus looking like the activity\nof a water spider. The new layout required rearrangements of water spider routes,\nsupermarket sizes and locations, and outbound logistics. The resulting simplified layout\nof the pallet flow racks is illustrated below with the outbound customer logistics docks.\n\nGravity-fed pallet flow racks\nOutbound logistics shipping dock\nFigure 3.8.2 Modified finishing layout with gravity-fed pallet flow racks\nThe other component of mitigating the inventory constraints was initializing negotiations\naround Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) with customers.\nThe pallet flow racks would allow the system to work given decent forecasts. However,\nthis business unit suffered from bias in forecasts as well as exceptions. To counter the\nexceptions, information flow needed to be improved across the enterprise. This could be\ncombated primarily through collaborative planning and forecasting. These processes\nwould allow Kodak to drive less unnecessary inventory into the system through early\nidentification and resolution of exceptions, allowing a larger amount of time to adjust the\nitem-level takt.\nEach of these steps has requirements for each party to fulfill. The process flow map from\nthe Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards Association is depicted below:\n1. Develop Front-End Agreement\n2. Create Joint Business Plan\n3. Create Sales Forecast\n4. Identify Exceptions for Sales Forecast\n5. Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items\n6. Create Order Forecast\n7. Identify Exceptions for Order Forecast\n8. Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items\n9.

The system is depicted\nbelow:\n\nFigure 3.8.3 Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) roadmap (VICS)\nAlthough this roadmap is fairly complete, the author needed to negotiate this technique as\nan effective strategy for the business unit to pursue in combination with the strategy.\nThe following results are the tentative agreement negotiated between different functions\nfor further negotiation with customers:\nFrequency\nItem\nDaily\nConsumption (scanned pulls)\nInventory (on-hand)\nUpdated rolling horizon daily forecast\n- Current day + (x Days)\nWeekly\nForecast exception review & revisions\nMonthly\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) review\n- Examples: forecast accuracy, inventory availability\nQuarterly\nBusiness goals & strategies\nJoint business plan, goals, and tactics\nTable 3.8.1 Negotiated application of CPFR to hybrid scenario\n\nSimultaneous with pursuing internal negotiations for CPFR information flows, the team\nestablished new information flows for Vendor Managed Inventory. In order to motivate\ncustomers to participate and align incentives to optimize all of distribution, consignment\ninventory at the customer locations was proposed. This business process redesign needed\ninformation inputs and outputs from international logistics and distribution as well as\ncoordination and viability information from I.T.\nThe proposed order flows for direct shipment and consignment inventory included four\nprocesses: The consignment fill-up process moved inventory from Kodak finishing to the\ncustomer consignment location. The consignment issue process issued inventory to the\ncustomer and triggered billing at the time of consumption. The consignment return\nprocess returned inventory to the customer consignment location and credited the\ncustomer (for demand changes and quality problems). The consignment pick-up process\nmoved inventory from the customer consignment location to Kodak finishing. The\nsubsequent business processes are illustrated below.\nFigure 3.8.4 Standard consignment order flow\n3.8.3 Team preparation\nThe team was updated with the analysis results, project deliverables and process\nredesigns. Another KOS team member took over my role on the project team.\nCustomer negotiations were underway at the time of internship closure.\n\nChapter 4: Organizational Processes\n4.1 Three Perspectives on Organizational Processes\nThis section examines the project using the three perspectives for analyzing\norganizational processes: strategic design, political, and cultural.\n4.1.1 Strategic design\nThe formal structure and strategy of the organization had substantial influence on the\nproject.\nThe strategy of the unit sponsoring my project, Global Manufacturing, was to implement\nlean production in order to improve service and quality while reducing inventory, capital,\nand labor costs. This operations strategy was being applied across several business unit\nmanufacturing flows.\nThe business unit constituted the wider environment of the organization in which I\nworked. The strategy of this business unit was to compete first on performance, quality,\nand service. However, as competition has gotten more intense in this market, supply\nflexibility and reliability have become significantly more important. These two metrics\nhave become a key differentiator for the business unit against rivals like Fuji.\nThe immediate project goal of integrating customers into Kodak's production control and\nlogistics tended to emphasize Global Manufacturing's unified operations strategy over\nthe segmented corporate strategy of the business unit. However, I realized this project\nhad been launched because the business unit's understandable increasing needs for\nsupply flexibility at the high end were placing severe operational and cost burdens on\nGlobal Manufacturing's upstream operations. Up until this point, they had been able to\nsignificantly reduce costs in other business units, but had been unable to significantly\nchange the cost structure of this unit's business model.\nAlthough the author is prevented from showing the formal designs of these two\norganizations in which the project was embedded, there is a very important \"dotted line\"\nrelationship from the business unit to Global Manufacturing. This indirect relationship\nwas an attempt at aligning behavior between these two organizations. However,\nunderneath this seeming alignment, there was a severe lack of aligned strategy and\nmetrics between the two organizations. This was a principle-agent problem in which the\nbusiness unit cared principally about customer service while not being responsible for its\neffects, including required inventory levels and excessive manufacturing costs. After\nGlobal Manufacturing instituted heijunka, or production leveling, the resulting \"hidden\"\ncosts of manufacturing capacity and overtime flexibility were dampened. However, the\nability to integrate customers into production control and logistics would have provided\ncustomers with visibility to the principle-agent problem. As a result, the strategic design\nfundamentally hindered the project.\n\n4.1.2 Political\n4.1.2.1 Major Stakeholders\nThe stakeholders involved in the project were based in six functional areas. Customers\nand Manufacturing stood to gain the most from the project, while Sales, Distribution,\nSupply Chain planning, and I.T. had the most to lose.\nStakeholder\nInterest\nGain\nLoss\nCustomers\nProvide prints in the correct\nImproves product\nPotential for service\nquantity, quality, and time to\navailability.\ndrops due to tightness.\ncomplementors and customers.\nReduces price, reducing\ntheir operating costs and\nprofit margins.\nSales\nCustomer service.\nPotential increase in\nLoss in commissions\ncommission from\nfrom one-time reduction\nimproved volume effect\non revenues.\nin sales.\nPotential reduction in\nImproved product\navailability.

The majority of manufacturing and customer stakeholders accepted\nthe project. However, some of this support was fragmented due to localized losses\noffsetting gains. These losses were important to both customers and manufacturing\n\nmanagers who would personally face increased inventory storage requirements even with\nthe fiscal and operational improvements for both organizations.\nI also found the reverse situation of fragmented opposition to the project. Although\ncertain functions like Sales and Supply Chain had substantial power to lose, they had\nthoughtful managers who understood the corporate- and network- wide benefits beyond\ntheir functional silos. These managers were willing to work with me and provide\nbeachheads of support in order to advance the project.\nFigure 4.1.1 Stakeholder map\n4.1.2.2 Compatibility of interests\nThese interests across functions were not entirely compatible. Although there was\noperational reciprocity between Manufacturing and Distribution, it was extremely\ndifficult to reconcile the diverging interests of these different groups. They can be\nchanged to be better aligned through two efforts: a better corporate strategy for managing\nthe tradeoff decision between the two groups and a more matrixed structure. First, a\ncorporate strategy needs to be developed to understand and manage the tradeoff between\ncost and service for this business unit. The coexisting requirements of 100% service\nlevel and infinite flexibility with significant capacity/inventory/labor cost reduction is not\na feasible corporate strategy: it is akin to a split-personality. Second, the single link\nbetween the business unit and a layer of manufacturing management is not significant\nenough to create any significant behavioral alignment between the two sets of groups.\nIndividual first-line managers metrics need to be modified, possibly through a Balanced\nScorecard initiative, to make a first rough-cut attempt at alignment and communication\nbetween these functions.\n\n4.1.2.3 Distribution of Political Power\nCustomers and sales dominated the political environment. The source of this power is\nactually an interesting interplay of industry dynamics and corporate strategy. Kodak\noriginally dominated the industry because it attained a first mover advantage. Pushing\ntechnology enhancements into silver halide film continually defended this first mover\nadvantage. As a result, Kodak established significant market share. However, competing\nfirms like Fuji have also been advancing the performance of their film portfolio. As a\nresult, for some customers, the technology is fulfilling many of their performance\nrequirements. This forced Kodak's corporate strategy to segment the market between\nhigh and low ends. While Kodak still retains a strong position in the lower segment, this\nsegment is their traditional base that provided the majority of volume and profit. While\ntheir segmentation strategy has been successful at the high end, the business unit needs to\ncreate a mitigation strategy if it hopes to retain substantial share of both segments. The\nlack of this mitigation strategy supporting the lower segment has resulted in them treating\nall products with the same metrics and priorities. This provides customers and sales with\nthe most power of any stakeholder group.\nThe success of the project may provide the ability to devise an operations strategy that\nlogically flows out of a segmented corporate strategy. This would relieve the business\nunit groups of many of their concerns while allowing manufacturing to pursue some of\ntheir cost objectives.\n4.1.2.4 History of Lack of Conflict Complicated Buy-In\nThe previous section discussed the need for a segmented operations strategy to cascade\ndown from the corporate strategy. Before the build-up of momentum in manufacturing\nfor their own lean operations strategy, manufacturing accepted the logic and requirements\nof business unit. Thus conflicts were primarily based on unexpected demand or\ndifficulties in planning, leading to requirements for manufacturing to flexibly respond.\nThus, the problem was primarily how high manufacturing jumped in response to the\nrequest, not if manufacturing should jump at all. This lack of serious conflict made the\nproject highlight complications arising out of the segmented corporate strategy and\nunified operations strategy for each subgroup.\nThus, many of the previous conflicts were amenable to effective conflict resolution and\nproblem solving. However, the different nature of conflicts arising out of the project\nmade them less responsive to this kind of resolution.\nThere have been disputes about this initiative. Due to the history of lack of conflict, most\npeople's views did not come out directly. They emerged during discussions of models or\nmethods. I personally found this to be the case during my attempts to build assumptions\ninto a model of the future system. Even though people could understand the model, they\nwould continually add new and more controversial assumptions, making it increasingly\ndifficult to bridge the gaps between groups. However, I was able to get people to see the\n\noverall picture for Kodak across functional silos using models. Models became enablers\nfor discussing interests and trying to cross-functional silos for the good of the company.\nThere were several measures I used to allow the less powerful parties to voice their\ninterests as they related to the project. First, I included representatives from every\nfunction affected on the team. This would help to extract conflicts of interest as well as\nimplementation challenges. Second, I attempted to use different types of interaction to\nresolve these conflicts. These included assumption inclusion in the model building\nprocess, brainstorming discussions, initiation of goodwill through thank you notes, and\nrequesting check-outs and feedback from meetings. All of these activities built a sub\nculture of open discussion without fear of reprisals. My only requirement was for\nmembers to be open to ideas that better positioned Kodak and the network as a whole in\nan improved financial and operational position.\n4.1.3 Cultural\n3.1.3.1 Symbolic Meaning of the Lean Enterprise Distribution Project\nThe Lean Enterprise Distribution project had a symbolic meaning for Kodak: the\npossibilities of expansion of lean from a manufacturing silo to the entire extended\nenterprise. For those of us in the Kodak Operating System office who understood the\npower of this concept as it applied to other industries, it was a small first step towards\nunleashing the competitive and evolutionary power of the production network.\nHowever, the Lean Enterprise Distribution project had different symbolic meanings to\ndifferent groups within the network. For customers, it was the opportunity to unlock cost\nreduction advantages. In the case of sales, the project represented a new direction in\ncustomer service, focusing less on requirements and more on value-added services.\nDistribution recognized it as a fundamentally new mental model in how logistics was\nfulfilled. For supply chain planning, the project represented a more leveraged and\neffective trend of inventory management. Manufacturing saw this as a building block out\nof their functional isolation. I.T. viewed this as a change initiative with significant cost\nreduction possibilities.\n4.1.3.2 Infusion of New Cultural Value: Total Value\nThe Lean Enterprise Distribution project attempted to change many of the norms, values,\nand basic assumptions of the production network's organizations. It was an extension of\nthe corporate values of a \"diverse and winning culture.\" This corporate culture is very\nsupporting of the growing lean subculture within manufacturing: the relentless search for\ntotal value. However, it is in partial opposition to other entrenched subcultures of partial\nvalue that unfairly trade benefits in one section of the extended enterprise for costs in\nanother. In this manner, it is the beginning of a more aligned and holistic approach to\ncorporate culture.\n\n4.1.3.3 Communication of Lean Enterprise Distribution within Kodak Culture\nThe project was formally being framed to others as a joint project between the business\nunit and manufacturing to improve our business process. Although I was impressed by\ncertain individuals' grasp of the importance for business units beyond Business Unit X,\nupper management still needed to better understand the fundamental goals for the\nextended enterprise. As a result, I was a member of a Kodak Operating System team to\nbuild and present a live interactive model of Kodak's future lean extended enterprise for\nsenior management, co-sponsored by the COO Charles Brown. We presented this to a\nlarge segment of senior management: Kodak's CEO Daniel Carp, the project's host\nbusiness unit president, every other business unit president, and a wide variety of other\nfunctions and units. It was an exciting first step in aligning metrics to facilitate\ndevelopment of a lean enterprise at Eastman Kodak Co.\n4.1.3.4 My Role Within the Kodak Culture\nI generally introduced myself to other organizational participants and members of my\nproject team as a student from MIT working on a change implementation project for\nKOS. Although the Kodak Operating System office has sponsored around five\ninternships in the last several years, Business Unit X had never experienced one before. I\nwas easily accepted into the KOS sub-culture. However, it took significant sensitivity\nand time to get accepted into the other sub-cultures. Without further support, I believe\npeople in these other subcultures will generally not appropriate the initiative for their own\nuse because of the negative implications for their subcultures.\n4.1.3.5 Interactions of the Three Perspectives\nThe three perspectives shed light on the limiting factors behind the project. The strategic\ndesign incoherence of alignment between segmented corporate and unified operational\nstrategy and separation of manufacturing from the business unit, political domination by\ncustomers and sales, and significantly different cultural implications quickly constrained\ntechnical solutions I developed for the project.\nThe strategic design perspective held the logical crux of the problem: misaligned\ncorporate with operational strategy. This misalignment informed the political analysis by\nproviding a tactical slant to the individual interests of each sub-group. These sub-group\ntactics then needed to be translated and interpreted for that particular culture.\nThis realization became crucially important for me to move ahead. I recognized the\norganizational implications from the three lenses and began making headway.\n\n4.2 Leading the Change Process\nThis section describes my application of the MIT Leadership Model for Catalyzing\nAction and Change to the Lean Enterprise Distribution project. It discusses how I went\nabout carrying out the four processes of Sensemaking, Relating, Visioning, and Inventing\n(Kochan), as well as the consequences of these actions.\n4.2.1 Sensemaking\nMy Sensemaking process consisted of two major components: listening and talking to\npeople, and creating a mental model.\nDuring the first three weeks of my internship, I focused on listening and talking with\npeople. I held 1-on-1 interviews with 22 people in eight different groups. These\ninterviews provided me with a variety of critical information, including the structure,\nculture, values, and resulting politics across groups. They also became opportunities to\nwiden my scope of influence through additional contacts and referrals. However, these\nprimarily became opportunities to \"break the ice\" and become enablers to develop\nworking relationships. After these initial interviews were completed, I traveled to the\nprimary sales region to see customers, the regional warehouse, and distribution planners\nthat I would need to interface with.\nI used a variety of other techniques to create my mental models of the situation. I\nattended the 7A.M. morning production \"huddle\" every day. This allowed me to begin to\nunderstand the issues many of the manufacturing, supply chain, and distribution people\ndealt with on a daily basis. I also created a KOS worldwide \"supply chain board.\" This\nboard took up an entire wall and illustrated the \"takt\" or flow rate of the major products\nfor the business unit I would be interfacing with. In addition, I quickly developed a\nstakeholder map with metrics to keep track of all these organizational relationships.\n4.2.2 Relating\nI developed the relating process through two stages: building credibility and developing\nworking relationships.\nI tried to build credibility during the first stage of relating. In a fairly rigid hierarchical\nculture, it is important to build credibility both from below and from above. From below,\nI worked on the production line and helped logistics with shipping for one week. As\nstated above, I attended the daily production \"huddles.\" From above, I requested help\nfrom a business unit manager to establish initial credibility with different functional\nmanagers. I also helped create and demonstrate a lean extended enterprise simulation for\nKodak's senior management. The combined credibility building from both below and\nabove created the initial conditions for fruitful relating.\nSecond, I began developing working relationships. This was primarily done initially\nthrough brainstorming sessions, one-on-one preparation before team meetings, and model\n\ndevelopment. I found model development to be a very effective tool to both develop\nrelationships and distill disagreements. I began by developing jointly agreed upon\nmetrics and calculations. This was necessary in order to establish initial buy-in.\nHowever, in order to maintain buy-in, I need to build-in and update different groups' key\nassumptions, like capacity constraints and lead times. This process allowed me to slowly\nbuild goodwill with different groups while attempting to create a new combined mental\nmodel. It was a time-consuming process, however. I would like to learn and develop\nmethods to systematize and improve the model building process as a tool for cross-\nfunctional communication and mental model building.\n\n4.2.3 Visioning\n\nThere were two basic steps in this process: creating and communicating the vision.\n\nFirst, I needed to create a vision for the project. The vision of a lean extended enterprise\nsimilar to Toyota was striking to me personally. Toyota's enterprise extends final\ncustomers to many tiers of suppliers deeply involved in the process. However, I realized\nthis may not be as exciting to other individuals and other functions. Therefore, I focused\non a vision that would unite these functional silos, one that would impact all of them: the\ncoming onslaught of digital. The film industry was mature and facing a disruptive\ntechnology shift. Meanwhile, different players in the value chain were fighting over a\nshrinking pie and blaming each other for high opportunity costs. Therefore, I argued they\nneeded to take action and collaborate to improve the efficiency of value chain.\nFundamentally, this would require shifting the nature of competitive advantage from\nindividual firms to the production network. I created a symbol of an elongated life cycle\ncurve to demonstrate the significance of the project, illustrated in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 4.2.1 Vision: Survive disruption! Extend the life cycle!\n\nThe second step I took was communicating the vision. I presented the vision in a\ntargeted workshop to form a coalition of key stakeholder supporters. I used this group to\nExpansion\nMaturity\nExtinction\nInnovation\nExpansion\nMaturity\nExtinction\nInnovation\n\ndevelop robust solutions across stakeholders, win them over, and prepare for a pilot\nimplementation. This group was crucial to the long term success of the project. I needed\nthis coalition to believe in both the vision and the project as an effective means of\ncarrying it out.\n4.2.4 Inventing\nWith the vision created, communicated, and a key coalition supporting it, I began\ninventing by segmenting the strategy into discrete tactics. This included improving\nmaterial flows through direct shipping, improving information flows through\nCollaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR), and establishing long\nterm contracts to support the process. One of the key requirements to involving\ncustomers in this process was sharing benefits from improvements with them, as well as\nsharing risks of production fluctuation.\nWe were well on the way to beginning the pilot with new plant floor layouts, equipment\nspecifications, and fire loading analyses completed\n4.2.5 My \"Dual Parallel Approach\" Change Signature; Feedback; Team Quality\nThe experience taught me how much I care about including people in the change process\nwhile keeping sufficient momentum. In previous change initiatives, I have tended to\noscillate between building momentum either from below or above. I had generally tried\nto include people and expected people to be helpful. However, since this would\nfrequently not happen, as expected under the Three Lenses, I would react and break this\ninertia by going above the individual. This approach is not very effective because people\nfirst underestimate your resolve and then are blindsided by pressure from above. Instead,\nI have tried a more simultaneous approach so that people affected know that I wanted\nthem involved and I care about their feelings, yet also understand that I need to maintain\nthe project's progress.\nI took several lessons of leadership feedback that I will use to develop my leadership\ncompetencies. First, I need to anticipate challenges to projects farther in advance. For\ninstance, before proposing methods or techniques, I need to anticipate which functions,\ngroups, or individuals may have issues with the proposal. If I can anticipate this, I would\npotentially be able to propose the topic differently or bring proposals to mitigate their\nconcerns. Second, I need to more frequently and directly voice my vision. I frequently\nonly express the vision only once to people. However, repetition, strength, and examples\nare needed to drive other people to take on deep convictions.\nSince I led a team as part of the project, I would rate the quality of team's internal\nprocesses as moderately weak and boundary management as strong. As discussed above,\nthe time and resource constraints created massive problems for the team formation and\nmanagement processes. As a result, the team's internal processes were weak. Although\nthe delegation and boundary management tasks were performed decently, the lack of\ncohesion within the group prevented any cumulative leaps forward for the team. I\n\nattempted to have the team improve through storming, but most of this resulted in\nmembers echoing their functional homes' complaints instead of working as a team.\n4.3 Evaluation and Recommendations\n4.3.1 Evaluation Using Metrics\nThe single metric commonly discussed at Kodak concerning the internships is Net\nPresent Value (NPV). As discussed previously, to be considered successful, projects\nmust identify and at least partially implement a value of >= $1 million NPV. Using this\nmetric, the project was successful since it both identified and partially implemented a\nproject that exceeded this measure. This business case was described previously in this\nthesis. In addition, it helped train senior management in lean enterprise techniques,\nimproved vertical functional communication, initiated horizontal functional\ncommunication, trained the implementation team and prepared key materials.\n4.3.2 Evaluation as a Change Process\nThe findings from the internship were widely distributed within the affected functions.\nThe recommendations have been generally accepted. Some groups, notably sales, have\nmade their acceptance contingent upon customer approval in final negotiations. The\nimplementation team is still intact and undergoing final customer negotiations. I believe\nthe changes will be sustainable because of the relatively minor technical changes\nrequired. However, if misaligned operational strategy and metrics reemerge as dominant\nforces, it could hinder further rollout of the pilot. I believe that substantial organizational\nlearning has occurred within the KOS office, particularly in understanding how important\nalignment of incentives is for the entire extended enterprise. I believe the learning will be\ndiffused to other units in the organization as KOS establishes formal offices and builds\ninfluence in adjacent functions, notably logistics, product development, and process\ndevelopment.\nBased upon my experience, I have several recommendations for those who might attempt\na similar project in this setting in the future. They should replicate being involved in a\ntight sub-function like KOS who has aligned overall goals. This was an impressive\nhotbed of collaborative learning and progress. In addition, they also replicate early and\nserious sensemaking efforts. The time spent at this stage of the process is well worth the\ncost. However, they should do their visioning differently. I developed my vision too late\nin the process. By the time I really understand the fundamental cause preventing\nsubstantial support behind the project, it was almost too late to develop the vision, get\nsupport, and establish a quick win. In retrospect, I am still uncertain, even if I had known\nthe fundamental problem of disconnected corporate and operational strategies, whether\nformalizing the vision would have solved the problem. I may have been working at too\nlow a point in the organization to have solved that fundamental problem. However, the\nadditional time may have proven critical given the correct powerful combination of\ncoalition and vision.\n\nChapter 5: Theory and application\n\"Like fire and atomic power, the concept of\nadaptation must be handled with care\"\n(Sober and Wilson, 101).\nThe Kodak Operating System office impressed me how effectively they learn, retain and\ninstitutionalize lean routines beneficial to Kodak. It made me consider how firms build\nroutines and capabilities, as well as evolve and compete over time.\n5.1 Theory of the Firm\nIn order to develop this understanding, I underwent an in depth literature review beyond\nthat already discussed. It initially began with research on lean enterprises, logistics,\nsupply chain, and operations research models. However, I soon recognized the need to\ndevelop a better understanding of the many dominant mental models in academic\nresearch underlying these other approaches. Unfortunately, most of the literature on the\ntheory of the firm has significant overlap and lacks any explicit modeling. The resulting\nmental models were distilled from management literature. Many are supported by\nScholl's integrative work on management theories.\n5.1.1 Neoclassical View (Economics)\nThe neoclassical view is the primary view held within economics. It assumes the\nfunction of the firm is to combine inputs through a production function. Under this\nmental model, all firms' capabilities and products are homogeneous. These firms also are\nassumed to be perfectly rational and have perfect information. The price mechanism\nkeeps markets in equilibrium. Meanwhile, individual firms have clear objective\nfunctions and always maximize profits.\nCombining of\nProduction Inputs\nProduction\nInputs\nDemand\nProducts/\nServices\nSatisfiable\nDemand by\nFirm\nReinvestments\nRevenues\nSurplus\nSatisfied\nNew Investments\nPayout\nDemand\nFigure 5.1.1 Mental model of the neoclassical view\n5.1.2 Transaction Cost (TC) View (Coase)\nRonald Coase wrote a seminal article in 1937 entitled \"The Nature of the Firm.\" He\nargued that firms exist for the sole reason of the ability to coordinate productive decisions\nmore effectively than the price mechanism of the market. The theory developed argued\n\nthat managers compete against the market to establish the lowest transaction costs. As\ntransaction costs decline, firms will inherently grow larger.\nSimilar to the neoclassical view, TC assumes the function of the firm is to combine inputs\nthrough a production function. Under this mental model, all firms' capabilities are not\nhomogenous while products are the same. These firms are still assumed to be perfectly\nrational and have perfect information. The price mechanism keeps markets in\nequilibrium, also determining the optimal boundary of the firm. Individual firms have\nclear objective functions and always maximize profits.\nProductive\nInputs\nCombining of\nProductive\nDemand\nInputs\nProducts/\nInput 1\nInput 2 Input n\nServices\nVariable Costs\nFixed\nCosts\nTotal\nSatisfiable\nSatisfiable Demand\nCosts\nReinvestments\nRevenues\nDemand by Firm\nby Market\nSurplus\nSatisfied\nDemand\nNew Investments\nPayout\nFigure 5.1.2 Mental model of the Transaction Cost view (adapted from Scholl, 9)\n5.1.3 Transaction Cost (TC) View (Williamson)\nThis view is the primary view behind many analysts of lean extended enterprises, notably\nDyer. Williamson expanded upon Coase's Transaction Cost view by including restricting\nassumptions of bounded rationality and opportunism upon individual agents of the firm.\nMeanwhile, additional environmental assumptions of information asymmetry within the\nfirm and uncertainty in demand in the market amplify these constraints. Firms can\nmitigate individual agent's opportunism through incentives and hierarchical control.\nSimilar to the traditional TC view, Williamson's extension assumes the function of the\nfirm is to combine inputs through a production function. Firms' capabilities continue to\nbe differentiated while products are homogenous. The major difference occurs around\nrationality and information: rationality is now bounded while information is both\nasymmetric and uncertain. The price mechanism keeps markets in equilibrium. The\nboundary of the firm is now complicated by asset specificity. Individual firms have\npotentially different objective functions.\nProductive\nInputs\nCombining of\nProductive Inputs\nProducts/\nService\nRevenue\nSurplus\nPayout\nReinvestment\nNew\nInvestments\nDemand of\nUncertain Degree\nSatisfiable\nFixed\nCosts\nVariable\nTotal\nCosts\nUncertai\nInput 1\nUncertai\nInput 2\nUncertain\nInput n\nSatisfiable Demand by\nMarket in Small\nNumber\nSatisfie\nDeman\nBounded\nRationality\nOpportunism\nInformation\nAsymmetry\nAsset\nDemand by Firm\nSpecificity\nFigure 5.1.3 Mental model of the extended Transaction Cost view (adapted from Scholl, 10)\n\n5.1.4 Agency View\nThe Agency view concentrates on the \"principal-agent problem\" in which a principle\nhires an agent to perform certain tasks on her behalf. This is a common occurrence in\nfirms between shareholders as principles and management as agents. Agents often have\ndivergent interests from principles. As a result, principles need to develop mechanisms\nto align agent's behavior with principles' goals. Frequently, this is accomplished through\n\"pay for performance\" or output-based contracts and incentives.\nSimilar to the extended TC view, agency theory assumes the function of the firm is to\ncombine inputs through a production function. However, firms' capabilities and products\nare now considered homogenous. Rationality is now driven by divergent rational self-\ninterest yet is bounded. Information remains both asymmetric and uncertain. The price\nmechanism keeps markets in equilibrium. The boundary of the firm is still complicated\nby asset specificity.

As a\nresult, \"stakeholder firms\" exist on the latter end of this continuum. Clarkson argues that\nfirm success depends upon ongoing satisfaction and acceptable returns to all primary\nstakeholders. These primary stakeholders frequently include employees, management,\nsuppliers, customers, unions, and shareholders.\nStakeholder theory assumes the function of the firm is to combine inputs through a\nproduction function. However, firms' capabilities and products are now considered\nhomogenous. It assumes perfect rationality and perfect information. The price\nmechanism keeps markets in equilibrium. Individual firms have potentially different\nobjective functions given different requirements to provide acceptable returns and\nconfidence in all stakeholders.\nThe stakeholder view is an ingrained assumption of most lean extended enterprises.\n\nFigure 5.1.5 Mental model of the Stakeholder view (adapted from Scholl, 12)\n5.1.6 Schumpeter View\nSchumpeter developed a theory of \"creative destruction\" in which exogenous market\nshocks allow entrerpreneurs to creatively recombine productive inputs and resources.\nThis enables these newcomers to establish competitive advantage and frequently conquer\nincumbent firms.\nSchumpterian theory assumes the function of the firm is to combine inputs through a\nproduction function. However, firms' capabilities and products are heterogeneous. It\nassumes bounded rationality and imperfect information. Markets are perpetually forced\nout of equilibrium due to these creative disruptions. Individual firms have potentially\ndifferent objective functions given potential paths to competitive advantage.\nFigure 5.1.6 Mental model of the Schumpeterian view (adapted from Scholl, 12)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\n5.1.7 Resource-Based View (RBV)\nWernerfelt and Penrose initiated the Resourced-Based View of the firm. Since then,\nsignificant contributions from a variety of authors have developed the ideas. Additional\ncontributors include Barney, Rumelt, Demsetz, Kogut and Zander, and Amit and\nSchoemaker. Critical reviews have been accomplished by Conner and Prahalad as well\nas Collis and Montgomery.\nThis view argues that organizational capabilities and core competences define the source\nof competitive advantage for a firm. The capabilities need to be heterogeneous and\nimmobile across firms in order to secure rents. These capabilities also must be\n\"nontradeable, nonimitable and nonsubstitutable\" (Dietrix and Kool, 1506-1507). In\nother words, capabilities must be valuable, rare, costly to imitate, and organized\n(\"VRIO\") in order to capture rents.\nRBV assumes the function of the firm is to build organizational capabilities and core\ncompetencies (that are VRIO) to compete. Firms' capabilities and products are\nheterogeneous and capabilities accumulate through path-dependence. It assumes\nbounded rationality and imperfect information of the sources of rival firms' capabilities.\nMarkets are frequently out of equilibrium as firms build capabilities to adapt to\nenvironmental changes. Individual firms have potentially different objective functions\ngiven different competency paths to competitive advantage.\nBounded\nRationality\nResource\n& Asset\nSpecificity\nCapital Material\nLabor (CML)\nCombining and\nRecombiningof CML\nProducts/\nServices\nRevenues\nRents\nDividends\nReinvestments\nNew Invest\nments\nDemand of\nUncertain Degree\nSatisfiable\nDemand by Firm\nFixed\nCosts\nVariable Costs\nTotal\nCosts\nMarket Shocks\nCompetitive\nAdvantage\nOrganizational\nCapabilities &\nCore\nCompetencies\nRent Creating\nAdded Value\nSatisfied\nDemand\nFigure 5.1.7 Mental model of the Resource-Based View (Scholl, 14)\n5.1.8 Dynamic Capabilities View\nThe Dynamic Capabilites view attempts to integrate the concepts of Schumpeterian\n\"creative destruction\" and the accumulation of organizational capabilities and core\ncompetencies from the Resource-Based View. By creating a higher-level concept of\nenvironmentally adaptive capabilities, firms can attempt to survive these disruptions.\nAccording to several authors,\n\nDynamic capabilities are \"the ability to reconfigure, redirect,\ntransform, and appropriately shape and integrate existing core\ncompetencies with external resources and strategic and\ncomplementary assets to meet the challenges of a time-pressured,\nrapidly changing Schumpeterian world of competition and\nimitation (Teece et al., p. 339).\nThis is an extremely important concept because it addresses the RBV assumption of\ninfinite organizational plasticity. Instead, firms must develop their capability to\ntransform competencies, which itself is a time- and path-dependent process. As a result,\nfrom a system dynamics perspective, the Dynamic Capabilities view establishes a\n\"cascading tower\" of organizational \"stocks.\"\nSatisfied\nDemand\nCapital Material\nLabor (CML)\nCombining and\nRecombiningof\nCML\nProducts/\nServices\nRevenues\nRents\nDividends\nReinvestments\nNew Invest\nments\nDemand of\nUncertain Degree\nSatisfiable\nDemand by Firm\nFixed\nCosts\nVariable Costs\nTotal\nCosts\nBounded\nRationality\nMarket Shocks\nCompetitive\nAdvantage\nOrganizational\nCapabilities &\nCore\nCompetencies\nRent\nCreating\nAdded\nValue\nResource &\nAsset\nSpecificity\nSearch &\nRenewal\nCapabilities\nPermanent\nMarket Turmoil\nFigure 5.1.8 Mental model of the Resource-Based View (Scholl, 15)\n5.1.9 Integrated model of the generic firm\nScholl developed an integrated model of a generic firm in order to better under firm\nlongevity. He incorporated four disciplines into the system dynamics model: economics\n(theory of the firm), strategic management (resource- and knowledge-based theories of\nthe firm), management science (stakeholder theory), and sociology (theory of syn\nreference). It also built upon de Geus' theory of the \"Living Corporation.\" The\nconclusion drawn from the formalization and integration of these theories resulted in\nvalidating the majority of de Geus' arguments. Three of de Geus' four traits of a \"Living\nCorporation\" were affirmed positively: organizational cohesion, sensitivity to the\nenvironment, and tolerance to new ideas.\nThe resulting \"COSID\" model included five model sectors: 1.) Capital, material, and\nlabor; 2.) Organizational capabilities and core competencies; 3.) Search and renewal\ncapabilities; 4.) Internal constituents' confidence; and 5.) Discretionary funds.\n\nFigure 5.1.9 Mental model of integrated generic firm, or \"COSID Model\" (Scholl, 185)\n5.1.10 Evolutionary view - Dual level individual with single mode (evolutionary\neconomics; biological reductionism)\nNelson and Winter initiated a new field of industrial analysis: evolutionary economic\ntheory. It built upon Schumpeter's theory of \"creative destruction.\" Evolutionary\neconomic theory argued against the use of neoclassical theory due to its strong\nassumptions concerning perfect rationality and information. Nelson and Winter used the\nbiological metaphor of natural selection and organizational genetics to describe\necological evolution among firms. The authors argued that firms develop routines, which\nare the organizational equivalent of genes. In this manner, routines function to ensure\nbehavioral continuity as an organizational analogue of genetic heredity. Since routines\nare costly and raise conflict to change, they generally have a property of inertia. They\ndefined three types of firm-specific routines: standard daily routines, periodically\nrecurring routines to alter the course of action (e.g. adjustments to investment decisions\naccording to current profitability), and standard routines for seeking improvements (of\nprocess and operating characteristics) (Scholl 63). Unlike routines, organizational\ncapabilities and individual skills require conscious decision making. Dosi et al. argued\nfirms adapt to disruption through combination and recombination of capabilities and\nknowledge.\nWithin evolutionary economics, most subsequent contributors have continued using\nNelson & Winter's assumptions. These assumptions include using routines as the unit of\nvariation and relying upon replicators for evolutionary control. This argument states that\nthe evolutionary dominance has a unidirectional flow from a single origination level in an\nunderlying replicators (e.g. genes, routines) up into their larger system (e.g. organism,\nfirm).\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nThere have been minor deviations on this theme, notably by Mathews and Kwasnicki.\nMathews attempted to link evolutionary economics with the Dynamic Capabilities view.\nHe used resources, routines, and relations as the units of variation. This variation\ngenerally arose through replication, imitation, recombination, and creation. The firm\nremains the unit of selection with additional emphasis on co-evolution of advantaged\nclusters.\nKwasnicki developed a model similar to Nelson & Winter with two exceptions: it used\nproducts as the unit of selection and it addressed large-scale fitness changes. All the\nprevious models assume a smooth environment of relative fitness resulting from\nvariation, or \"fitness landscape.\" Kwasnicki attempted to integrate \"rugged fitness\nlandscapes\" in which there are multiple peaks of high relative fitness. Firms undergoing\nreplicator variation must pass through low relative fitness, or valleys, in this rugged\nlandscape to reach higher peaks.\nR&D funds\npublicized\nknowledge\nsearch for\ninnovation\nsearch through\nimitation\ninventions\nmodernization, innovation,\nand radical innovation\nselection\nunit cost\nreal profit and\nincome\nfirm's capital\ninvestment\ncapacity\ncredit's availability\nfirm's saving\nfirm's debt\nproduction and\ninvestment decisions\nproduction offered\nfor sale\nproduction sold on\nthe market\nexpected profit and\nincome\nprice\ntechnical\ncompetitiveness\ncapital productivity\nproduct's\ncompetitiveness\nmarket share\nestimation\naverage competitiveness\nestimation\nmarket structure\naverage price\nestimation\nexpected production to\nbe sold on the market\nFigure 5.1.10 Mental model of evolutionary economics (Kwasnicki, 85)\nFigure 5.1.11 Rugged fitness landscape introduces challenges to evolutionary economics\n(Kwasnicki, 85)\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\n5.1.11 Evolutionary view - Dual level individuals with multiple modes (Fujimoto)\nIn refreshing contrast to the evolutionary economics approach, there is a small yet\ngrowing evolutionary viewpoint arising out of operations management and lean\nproduction. Fujimoto, Nishiguchi, and Sako are the first proponents of this view that I've\ncome across.\nFujimoto developed a compelling taxonomy of the evolution of the Toyota Production\nSystem. He argued that Toyota developed its capability through the interaction of an\ninternal evolutionary system with an external selection mechanism. The internal\nevolutionary system consisted of the three basic components of variation, selection, and\nretention. However, unlike evolutionary economics, variation did not occur through\nisotropic variation arising out of simple replication. Variation arose from a variety of\nmodes, including environmental constraints, knowledge transfer, rational calculation,\nentrepreneurial vision, and random trials. Subsystems of Toyota's manufacturing\nroutines developed through these multiple paths.\nFigure 5.1.12 Multiple evolutionary modes; Mutli-Path System Emergence(Fujimoto,9)\nAfter this variability arose, these crude solutions were internally selected and refined\nthrough Toyota's evolutionary learning capability. Next, these solutions were further\ndeveloped through Toyota's learning and operational capabilities, generally resulting in\nimproved operational performance. Since these ingrained routines had inertia, however,\nit sometimes resulted in overshooting as the external environment changed and\npurification as the routines were transferred, particularly from Japan to the United States.\nThe process was finally completed through internal and external selection due to the\nimproved operational performance.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nFigure 5.1.13 Mental model of capability building at Toyota (Fujimoto, 273)\n5.2 Evolutionary view - Hierarchical individuals with multiple modes (White)\nTwo features of the previous evolutionary research were particularly intriguing. Most\naccounts relied solely on selection as the mode of evolution and upon the firm or product\nas the sole level for the unit of selection.\nFirst, most accounts of evolutionary economics relied heavily upon the single mode of\nevolution - selection. This contrasted with Fujimoto's multiple path system emergence.\nSince these paths created a large creative pool in high relative frequency for the forces of\ninternal selection to work upon, these multiple paths defied the evolutionary economics'\nview of variability creation through mutation during replication of the unit of evolution.\nSecond, all accounts of evolutionary economics used the firm or product as the only level\nfor a unit of selection. In contrast, Fujimoto used both an internal and external selection\nprocess to describe the development of Toyota's capabilities. Although firms are the\nbusiness analogue of organisms, they do not come under such a harsh selection\nenvironment. In addition, there are multiple levels of selection that can occur both within\nfirms - at the individual, workgroup, project, and business unit levels - as well as across\nfirms - at the strategic alliance, strategic network, production network, industry, nation,\nand regional levels. Technologies can also be viewed across their multiple levels - at the\nbasic science, applied science, system, and component levels.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nUnfortunately, all the accounts I reviewed shared several of the following assumptions:\n1. Evolutionary development is a process of variationaselectionainheritance\n2. Selection is the only mode of evolution\n3. Firms or products are the unit of selection, or evolutionary individual\n4. Routines are the unit of variation and holder of inheritance\n5. Firms deal with rugged fitness landscapes through saltation\nThe combination of these points, including mode of evolution and unit of selection,\nrequired more firm answers. A mammoth book by Stephen Jay Gould, entitled The\nStructure of Evolutionary Theory, became one of the key influences on my ideas.\nGould argued that evolutionary theory needed to be revised along three Darwinian axes:\n(1) agency, or organismal struggle as the appropriate (and nearly exclusive) level of\noperation for natural selection;\n(2) efficacy, or natural selection as the creative force of evolutionary change (with\ncomplexly coordinated sequelae of inferred principles about the nature of variation, and\nof commitments to gradualism and adaptationism as foci of evolutionary analysis); and\n(3) scope, or extrapolationism (inference of history from single objects based on quirks,\noddities and imperfections that must denote pathways to prior change) (Gould, 59).\n5.2.1 Revision of agency to hierarchical evolutionary \"individuals\"\nOn the first point of agency, Gould created the notion of an evolutionary \"individual.\"\nEvolutionary individuals were defined to have certain criteria, including:\n1.) Production of new individuals\n2.) Elimination of individuals\n3.) Sources of cohesion through stability of the individual, boundaries against\ninvasion, and \"glue\" of subparts\n4.) Inheritance\n5.) Source of new variation in newborn individuals\nAlong these criteria, he argued that there was a \"hierarchy\" of evolutionary individuals:\nfrom the lowest level of genes through to the highest level of clades. Organisms were\nsimply one of these evolving levels. However, the interesting construction of this\nhierarchy is the nesting character of relationships: each evolutionary \"individual\" consists\nof parts of lower evolutionary \"individuals\" and is itself part of the collectivity of a\nhigher evolutionary \"individual.\"\nField of study\nLevels of Evolutionary \"Individuals\"\nPart\nIndividual\nCollectivity\nBiology\nGene, cell\nOrganism\nDeme, Species,\nClade\nBusiness\nRoutine/relation/\nresource\nFirm\nDyadic alliance,\nProduction network\nTable 5.2.1 Levels of Evolutionary \"Individuals\"\n\n5.2.2 Revision of efficacy to include multiple modes of change\nAlthough hierarchical levels of evolutionary \"individuals\" is theoretically feasible, it was\ninteresting to see how evolution complemented this with multiple modes of change.\nGould argued there were three basic modes of change:\n1.) Drive, or directional variation within or between individuals\n2.) Selection, or differential proliferation due to traits of interactors\n3.) Drift, or random differential proliferation\nGould argued that each evolutionary \"individual\" in the hierarchy used these multiple\nmodes in a unique way. For instance, although selection through differential death is the\npredominant mode of organism, species are generally most impacted by differential\nspeciation and founder drift.\nModes of change\nFeature\nOrganismal level\nSpecies level\nDrives, or Directional\nHeritable ontogenetic change\nLamarckism - powerful if it occurred\nAnagenesis (gradualism within\nVariation within or\nwithin the individual =\nspecies)\nBetween Individuals\nontogenetic drive\nBiased production of new\nMutation pressure\nDirectional speciation\nindividuals = reproductive drive\nSelection, or Differential\nProliferation Due to Traits\nof Interactors\nBasis in birth\nDifferential birth\nDifferential speciation\nBasis in death\nDifferential death\nDifferential extinction\nDrift, or Random\nDifferential\nProliferation\nWithin the collectivity\nGenetic drift\nSpecies drift\nIn founding new collectivities\nFounder effect\nFounder drift\nTable 5.2.2 Three modes of change exist for biological evolutionary \"individuals\";\neffective mechanisms are highlighted (Gould, 717-718)\nThere are strong parallels between the traits of evolutionary \"individuals\" like organisms\nand firms. Both exhibit the characteristic of trading off control of lower level individuals\nfor functional integration and performance. A parallel argument can be made for the\n\"individuals\" like species and production networks. Both exhibit the characteristic of\nmuch lower control over lower level individuals for access and leveraging of their unique\nevolutionary potentials.\nA major difference between biological and organizational/technological evolution is the\nexistence and power of Lamarckism at the firm level. Lamarckism is the theory that\nevolutionary individuals evolve by the inheritance of traits acquired or modified through\nthe use or disuse of body parts. This theory has been rejected in biological evolution in\nfavor of another functionalist approach: Darwinism. Although giraffes cannot inherit the\ngenetic traits required for a longer neck simply by stretching for higher leaves on trees,\norganizations surely can act themselves to change their routines and technological ideas.\nThe resulting evolutionary implications for higher evolutionary individuals like\nproduction networks and technology architectures place a high emphasis on drift and\ndifferential or biased creation of networks.\n\nModes of change\nFeature\nFirm level\nProduction network level\nDrives, or Directional\nHeritable ontogenetic change\nLamarckism - powerful\nAnagenesis (gradualism within\nVariation within or\nwithin the individual =\nalliance/network)\nBetween Individuals\nontogenetic drive\nBiased production of new\nMutation pressure\nDirectional network creation\nindividuals = reproductive drive\nSelection, or\nDifferential\nBasis in birth\nDifferential birth\nDifferential network creation\nProliferation Due to\nBasis in death\nDifferential death\nDifferential extinction\nTraits of Interactors\nDrift, or Random\nDifferential\nProliferation\nWithin the collectivity\nGenetic drift\nNetwork drift\nIn founding new collectivities\nFounder effect\nFounder drift\nTable 5.2.3 Three modes of change exist for organizational evolutionary \"individuals\";\neffective mechanisms are highlighted (adapted from Gould, 717-718)\n5.2.3 Revision of scope to include structural, historical, and functional factors\nHis previous revision to include the modes of natural selection as a counterweight to\nstrict Darwinian functional adaptation still could not counter arguments of\nextrapolationism. Since Gould was a paleontologist, he recognized massive gaps in the\nfossil record followed by extremely short periods of intensive change. He called this\nprocess \"punctuated equilibrium\" because the fossil record generally laid in relative stasis\nuntil a new species was created. Strict Darwinian functional selectionists argued that the\nevolutionary process for individuals at levels higher than their level of analysis (typically\nthe gene or organism) was predetermined through \"upward causality.\" As Gould's\nanalysis demonstrated, each level had unique irreducible evolutionary dynamics that\ncould not be simply assumed away through extrapolation.\nTherefore, Gould analyzed the three \"schools\" of evolutionary thought: functional,\nhistorical, and structural causality of form. The symbol he used was the aptive triangle.\ne.g. Dyer, Sako, Nishiguchi; Schumpeter\nFunctional\nStructural\nSpandrels (other features)\n\"Physical\" forces\nParallelism (positive enabling channels)\nExaptive Pool:\ne.g. Fujimoto, Adner & Levinthal\n*Saltation:\nStakeholder, Schumpeter, Evolutionary economics\n*NOTE: reject saltationist theories\n- Spandrels (architectural consequences)\n- Manumissions (historical unemployments)\n- Insinuations (invisible introductions)\ne.g. Neoclassical, RBV, Principal-Agent,\nHistorical\nDeep homology (negative limitation)\ne.g. *Christensen\n*NOTE: insinuation & functionalism\ne.g. Fine, Control Systems\nFigure 5.2.1 The \"Aptive Triangle\" (modified from Gould, 1052)\n\nSince functional arguments of form were the strongest, he looked first at historical\narguments and then at structural arguments.\nHistorical causes of form\nThe historical school included two components: deep homology and parallelism. He\nused new finding from \"evo-devo,\" or evolutionary developmental biology, to develop\nmany of these arguments around historical channeling causality of form. First, \"deep\nhomology\" was the finding that distantly related animal phyla had conserved\ndevelopmental genetic pathways. Underlying historical archetypes were found to have a\nlarge limiting influence on the directions of change. Cascading development \"rules\"\nwere found in \"evo-devo\" in which controlling genes, like the maternal genes bicoid and\nnanos, activate controlled genes. This cascading control consisted of maternal genes, gap\ngenes, pair-rule genes, segment-polarity genes, and Hox genes for certain animal phyla.\nAs a result of the cascading rules and channeling effects, small genetic variation at\ndifferent levels resulted in very different phenotypic effects. Most importantly, however,\nchanneled genes acted like developmental \"cassettes\" that limited the directions of\npotential evolution. Second, \"parallelism\" was defined as a constraint in underlying\ngenerators. This was in opposition the concept of \"convergence,\" in which natural\nselection developed a homologous form through a malleable substrate lacking constraint.\nSeveral examples, including the development of the eye in several animal species, lent\nthemselves to the explanation of parallelism over convergence to their current form. As a\nresult, similar forms across distant phyla also channel future changes in preferred\ndirections.\nGiven this negative limiting and positive channeling of evolutionary direction, the\nresulting morphospace of phenotypic characteristics was not homogenous.\n\"Inhomogenous occupation of morphospace...must be explained largely by the limits and\nchannels of historical constraint, and not by the traditional mapping of organisms upon\nthe clumped and nonrandom distribution of adaptive peaks in our current ecological\nlandscapes\" (Gould, 1174). This was a refreshing argument since discussions of rugged\nfitness landscapes primarily discuss the implications on overt mechanisms of change.\nStructural causes of form\nThe primary argument of the book, however, goes beyond historical positive channels\nand negative limits on evolution. The structural school considered two structural\ninfluences on form: physical forces and spandrels.\nProponents of physical forces argued that the evolution of form was driven primarily by\nexternal forces and not by historical or functional constraints. One of the main\nproponents in this school, D'Arcy Thompson, argued that form is determined by forces\nlike gravity, surface tension, and fluid friction. Form, particularly geometric form, is\nestablished by the array of forces most prominent for the organism. For instance, small\norganisms are subject to forces primarily on their surface whereas medium size\norganisms are subject to forces that act on both its surface and on its volume. However,\n\nthe external forces argument fell apart when trying to deal with the complexity of larger\norganisms. Although appealing for small organisms, the concepts of historical channels\nbecame much more appealing for larger organisms.\nSecond, Gould argued that the primary structural constraints are \"spandrels.\" Before\ndefining the term, it is important to understand the context out of which it arose.\n\"Spandrels\" came out of the \"quirky functional shift\" problem in Darwinism. Originally,\nMivart, a structuralist opponent of Darwin, claimed to have trumped Darwinist selection\nwith the following \"5 percent of a wing.\" To my astonishment, Darwin had grappled\nwith this and developed a semi-working solution.\nFive percent of a wing offers no conceivable aerodynamic benefit\nfor an organism. As such, it would not be formed under a smooth\nregime of natural selection for flight. Thus, the incipient stages\nmay have performed a different function, for which their five\npercent of a wing imparted benefits. Eventually, the enlarging\nprotowing entered the domain of aerodynamic benefit, and the\noriginal function changed to the primary utility now exploited by\nmost birds. Current function cannot be equated with reasons for\nhistorical origin. (Gould, 1223)\nThe resulting concept of \"quirky functional shift\" was Darwin's brilliant response to\nMivart. On the surface, this response allowed functional selection to remain unscathed.\nHowever, it required redundancy with two functions for one structure or two structures\nfor one function. Since Darwin proposed a restrictive version of functional shifting, it\nremained fully adaptational. Unfortunately, even this restricted version is often either not\noriginally known or underplayed in most applications of evolutionary theory. As a result,\nour understanding of evolutionary change is impaired. Many of the evolutionary\neconomics texts and articles I read needed to rely on \"saltation,\" which is defined as\n\"discontinuous movement, transition, or development; advancement by leaps.\" Where\nauthors even assumed rugged landscapes, saltation was the frequent response to moving\nbetween localized maxima. For instance, Kwasnicki relied on recrudescence, or the\n\"search for original, radical innovations by employing daring, sometimes apparently\ninsane, ideas\" (Kwasnicki, 9). The more ingrained use of saltation was expressed by\nPerkins in his reliance upon substantial increases in underlying variability in order to\nnavigate through valleys in \"Klondike landscapes.\" Both approaches could be improved\nthrough the application of \"quirky functional shift.\"\nSpandrels developed as the structural foundation for \"quirky functional shift.\" A\nspandrel is an architectural term, meaning \"the roughly triangular space between the left\nor right exterior curve of an arch and the rectangular framework surrounding it; the space\nbetween two arches and a horizontal molding or cornice above them.\" Gould argued that\n\"spandrels originated as a nonadaptive side-consequence of a prior architectural\ndecision. These originally nonadaptive spaces were then coopted...as \"canvasses\" for\nwonderfully appropriate designs. In biological terms, the mosaic designs are secondary\nadaptations, and the spandrels themselves then become exaptations for the residence of\nthose designs\" (Gould 1253).\n\nFigure 5.2.2 The spandrels of San Marco (denoted with ellipses)\nSince spandrels are only one type of resource for \"quirky functional shift,\" Gould\ndeveloped the concept of the \"exaptive pool.\" Since spandrels represent a structural, not\nfunctional, resource that is inherent in many evolutionary processes, it would be correct\nto view most available resources as \"aptations\" instead of \"adaptations.\" In addition,\nevolutionary individuals maintain this \"fund\" or \"pool\" of potential utilities as a source\nfor future fitness or evolvability. Therefore, I shall refer to it as the individual's\n\"exaptive pool.\"\nFeature\nNickname\nOrigin\nInherent potentials\nFranklins\nAvailable things\nMiltons\nAt-level\nspandrels by\ngeometry\nSpandrels\nStructural\nCross-level\nspandrels by\ninjection\nAs historical\nunemployments\nManumissions\nHistorical\nAs invisible\nintroductions\nInsinuations\nHistorical\nTable 5.2.4 Taxonomy of the exaptive pool (Gould, 1280).\nThere is a wide variety of examples of exaptations in biology, including the redundancy\nand combinatorial flexibility within genomes arising from \"junk DNA,\" the flexibility\nderived from developmental channels in \"evo-devo,\" and the flexibility, persistence, and\ncapacity for change in an evolving population.\n5.2.4 Synthesis of revisions\nA set of arguments were previously made: first, selection works simultaneously at several\nhierarchically ordered levels of evolutionary individuality. Second, cross-level spandrels\noriginate automatic expressions levels other than the focus of application. These are\nintroduced into the coopting level simultaneously as changes occur in the original\nseparate evolutionary channel on a different focal level. Since cross-level sprandrels\n\npropagate to various levels of the evolutionary hierarchy, they fundamentally enable the\nevolutionary individual's evolvability.\nSpandrels and historical constraints provide substantial power to contingency. Since\nhistorical origin cannot be equated with current utility, evolution's process cannot simply\nbe extrapolated from microevolutionary mechanics. Within biology, genes do not have\ntotal control of upward causality to higher evolutionary individuals. Likewise, within\norganizations, routines do not fully control the evolvability of the firm. Meanwhile, in\ntechnologies, component ideas do not control the long term success of a particular\narchitecture or dominant design.\nIn addition, the exaptive pool provides crucial insights into the uniqueness and power of\ndifferent evolutionary individuals. In this framework, species derive their capability not\nfrom functional integration and active adaptation. Instead, species' evolvability comes\nfrom the species' ability to leverage inwardly cascading exaptive effects from lower-\nlevel individuals.\n\"The species-individual, as a Darwinian interactor in selection at\nits own level, operates largely with cross-level exaptations arising\nfrom unsuppressed evolution of subparts (primarily organisms)\nat lower levels within itself. Such nonsuppression acts as a\nsource of evolutionary potential by permitting species to draw\nupon a wider pool of features than organism can access...By not\nsuppressing this evolutionary churning from within, the species-\nindividual gains enormous flexibility in remaining open to help\nfrom below, expressed as exaptive effects that confer emergent\nfitness...we should interpret these allometrically driven properties\nas cardinal strengths, and recognize the species as a \"rich-but-\ndifferent\" Darwinian individual. The species, in this view, acts as\na shelter or arbor that holds itself fast by active utilization of the\nproperties that build its well-defined individuality. By fostering\ninternal change, and thereby gaining a large supply of inwardly\ncascading exaptive effects, species use the features of all\ncontained lower-level individuals through the manifestation of\ntheir effects on the shelter itself (Gould, 1293).\n5.3 Application to Business Models and Technologies\nTechnologies are another type of evolutionary individual that is increasingly being\nanalyzed within evolutionary theory.\nUnfortunately, due to the strict functionalism of most evolutionary camps, most have\nlimited their analyses to areas like research idea variability.\nCohen and Malerba argued that variability of innovative activity within industries\nstimulates technological progress in three ways: selection effect, breadth effect, and\ncomplementarity effect. The selection effect described the process in which firms\n\ncompete on quality and cost for market selection. As more variants competed, the\nwinning variant was expected to have an improved quality per unit cost. The breadth\neffect described the improved technological progress resulting from firms pursuing\ndistinct, non-competing, and independent approaches to innovation. The\ncomplementarity effect enhanced technical progress through the application of\ninformation from one course of R&D to a different but related activity (Cohen &\nMalerba, 592, 594-595).\nUnfortunately, this result is not very prescriptive for what firms need to do in order to\nimprove the evolvability of their technologies. Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma has\nbeen a terrific catalyst to addressing the supply-side character of most technology\nstrategy. I believe Christensen's concept of disruptive technologies is a direct result of\nstructural constraint, notably across-level spandrels. Christensen defines disruptive\ntechnologies as lower performance technologies that successfully invade the lower tier of\nthe market due to incumbent's highly profitable current customer base and the trajectory\nof sustaining technology.\nThe issue of sustaining versus disruptive technologies is fundamentally a question of the\ncontours of fitness landscapes. As discussed previously, a few evolutionary economists\nrefer to rugged landscapes. Perkins defined a \"Klondike\" landscape as one that includes:\n- Large space, few solutions (wilderness gap)\n- No clues pointing direction (plateau gap)\n- Solution isolated from where search starts (canyon trap)\n- Area of high promise but not over solution threshold (oasis trap) (Perkins, 162)\nDisruptive business models can be defined as a global performance optimum within a\ncanyon trap. Conventional adaptive selection (trial-and-error with many variants) and\nLamarckian drive (preferred design concept) both stay away from canyon traps because it\nwould incrementally lead to lower interim fitness. This lower interim fitness is the\nanalogy of upper segment customers supporting only sustaining improvements that\ngradually improve performance. Since lower end customers can accept lower\nperformance, they fundamentally provide a different selection criterion. This shift in\nselection criterion is a form of \"quirky functional shift.\" Depending on the individual\ntechnology or business model, these shifts can frequently be in the exaptive pool, notably\nas cross-level spandrels. Exaptations in technology and business models is illustrated.\n\nApplication 2 for\nApplication 1 for\nApplication 2 for\nspandrel Z1-C\nspandrel Z1-C,\nApplication 1 for\nanother firm/product\nApplication 1 for\nApplication 1 for\nApplication 1 for\nother firm/product\nApplication 2 for\nApplication 1 for\nother firm/product\nanother firm/product\nspandrel Z1-A\nApplication 2 for\nspandrel Z1-A,\nspandrel Z1-B\nspandrel Z2-A\nspandrel Z2-C,\nspandrel Z2-B\nspandrel Z2-B,\nspandrel Z2-B\nFigure 5.3.1 Spandrel evolution model (component technologies or organizational\nroutines). Given feasible requirements for an application's technology portfolio or\norganizational routine, the firm will exapt a spandrel to escape the evolutionary trap.\nAdner and Levinthal came to a remarkably close conclusion. They argued that\ntechnologies develop along certain trajectories and go through a \"speciation\" event.\nFigure 5.3.2 Technology speciation model (Adner & Levinthal, 25)\nThese authors made several interesting examples of the powerful role of exaptation in\ntechnology development. They described its impact on wireless communications,\nmedical imaging, and video recording technology.\n\nFigure 5.3.3 Technology speciation example in medical imaging (Adner & Levinthal, 25)\nThese arguments are similar in many ways. However, the argument for regarding these\n\"quirky functional shifts\" as exaptations rather than speciation is important. Exaptation\nallows a modular conception of technology development. It allows component\ntechnologies and even the architecture itself to remain the same, regardless of application.\nIn contrast, speciation assumes selection has changed lower level evolutionary\nindividuals within the technology. Although it is a subtle difference, it will be an\nimportant difference in understanding the strategic implications for development.\n5.4 Application to Lean Extended Enterprises\nThe application of these ideas to organizations is an interesting task. I decided to start by\nanalyzing key routines at Toyota. These were well documented by Fujimoto and\nprovided the best opportunity to integrate concepts from the lean enterprise and\nevolutionary disciplines.\nThe following table connects each set of routines to the aptive source as well as the\nmechanism by which they emerged. The intriguing point is how little functional adaptive\nselection played upon the development of routines for the extended enterprise. At this\nlevel, the exaptive pool provided the majority of innovative resources from different\nlevels upon which Toyota drew strength.\n\nAptive\nMechanism\nFirm-Level Routines\nProduction Network-Level Routines\nsource\nJust-in-\nTime\nMulti\nTasking\nJidoka and\nFlexible\nKaizen\nand\nBlack\nBox\nHeavyweight\nProduct\nSupplier\nassociation/\nwith\nEquipment\nTQC\nParts\nManager\nconsulting/\nProduct-\nFocus\nSupplier\nlearning\nLayout\nteams\nFunctional\nDrive:\nLamarckism/Vision\nX\nX\nX\nSelection: Adaptation\nHistorical\nDrive: Deep\nhomology/channeling\nX\nX\nX\nX\nDrive: Parallelism\nX\nX\nX\nStructural\nDrive: External /\n\"physical\" forces\nX\nX\nX\nX\nDrive: Internal\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nExaptive\nSprandrel (Across)\nX\nX\nX\nX\nPool\nSprandrel (Within)\nX\nX\nX\nInsinuations (Across)\nX\nX\nTable 5.4.1 Mapping Toyota Production System subsystems to \"Aptive Triangle\"\nRoutines primarily developed at the level of the firm were generally exapted from within\nand driven through a combination of Lamarckian drive, historical deep homology, and\nstructural internal channeling. Extended subsystems were generally exapted from across\nand driven through a combination of historical parallelism, structural external forces and\nstructural internal channeling.\nThese results confirm Gould's hypothesis that lower level evolutionary individuals rely\nmore heavily upon functional integration while higher-level individuals rely upon the\nactive usurpation upward potential. In this sense, Toyota began behaving more like a\nhigher evolutionary individual, the extended enterprise, than an individual firm.\nThe foundation of Toyota's competitive advantage lay in its' ability to identify and utilize\nspandrels arising from within while subsequently building these within their positive\nhistorical channels. However, they extended this competitive advantage through further\nidentifying spandrels beyond their immediate level and utilizing these to counteract\nexternal forces given their internal constraints. The combination of their ability to\nleverage the entire exaptive pool provided the basis for them first to establish a lean\nenterprise and to expand into a lean extended enterprise.\nThe firm's ability to combine the exponentially increasing power of the exaptive pool for\nextended enterprise evolvability was buttressed by two other related processes:\n1.) Development of a \"package\" of primary and secondary behaviors in order to\n\"amplify altruism\"\n2.) Establishment as keystone ecological role to enable niche complementors\nSober and Wilson wrote an excellent book on group selection. Although I favored the\nlogical coherence of Gould's account, Wilson had a terrific insight on initiating change:\nhow to \"amplify altruism.\"\n\"The use of secondary behaviors to promote altruistic primary\nbehaviors can be called the amplification of altruism. The\n\npopulation structure of many human groups may not be sufficient\nfor altruistic primary behaviors to evolve by themselves, but may\nbe sufficient for primary and secondary behaviors to evolve as a\npackage. Since the secondary behaviors cause the primary\nbehaviors, behaviors that evolve in human groups can be similar to\nthose that evolve in species with more extreme population\nstructures, such as clonal organisms and social insect colonies\"\n(Sober and Wilson, 146).\nPrimary behaviors typically help the group substantially but come at a significant\npotential cost to the actor. A prime example of this within Toyota's extended enterprise\nis suppliers' agreement to target costing. This substantially helps the network since it\nprovides the basis for long-term improvement. However, it potentially costs the supplier\na great deal since they are liable to \"hold-up\" from Toyota during negotiations since\nToyota attains process and financial information in the improvement process.\nSecondary behaviors are reinforcing behaviors that come at a small cost to the actor.\nThey can be positive or negative in design. Examples of positive behaviors include\nrewards, like suppliers keeping the majority of jishuken improvements and the ability to\njoin the supplier association. Examples of negative behaviors include Toyota performing\nstrong audits if suppliers do not meet the agreed target cost and the potential cultural\nramifications from severing of relations.\nThe resulting combination of evolutionary mechanisms with lean extended enterprise\nvalues can be used to understand the evolutionary mechanisms behind product, process,\nand value chain dynamics.\nFigure 5.4.1 Evolutionary mechanisms and dynamics of industry structure\n\nToyota's subsystems developed through this process. The importance of spandrels\nemphasize the relative importance of structural effects on the development of TPS:\nFigure 5.4.2 Development of Toyota Production System through Evolution\nGiven the interactions of industry dynamics and evolutionary dynamics, lean enterprises\nneed to establish object-oriented partitioning of complexity. These partitions create\nseparate spheres of influence for incremental innovation and architectural innovation at\nmultiple levels in enterprises. Incremental innovation relies upon dense, antiredundant,\nlocally adaptable sources of variability reduction. Continuous improvement, six sigma,\nand process reengineering are all increasingly powerful tools. Architectural innovation\nleverages loose, redundant, evolvable sources of variability amplification. Complexity\npartitioning is distinct from simple variability decoupling. It implies the ability for the\nsystem to benefit from both spheres of incremental and architectural innovation.\nThis object-oriented complexity partitioning enables value to flow through value\ncreation, value capture, value development, and value delivery. Many firms do this by\nsetting up organizational barriers between research and development, as well as by\nestablishing separate venture capital arms for internal innovation and external innovation.\nHowever, the partitioning strategy must focus at multiple levels beyond organizational\nboundaries. This thesis described techniques to establish and extend a value delivery\nheijunka to partition the system from downstream variability and provide stability for\nupstream variability reduction.\nLikewise, a value creation heijunka is necessary to partition lean enterprises across\ndifferent types of complexity. Several authors have discussed various forms of\ncomplexity partitioning in enterprises. Wheelright & Clark established \"aggregate\nproject plans\" as a technique for partitioning complexity entering the enterprise research\nand development funnel in the form of breakthrough, platform, and derivative projects.\nThis partitioning systematically allowed firms to allocate resources and to focus on high\nvariability ideas with substantially different business models and technologies.\n\nSridhar Sadasivan's notion of clockspeed boundary modularity established an example of\ncomplexity partitioning in the field of value development. Firms that employ this\nmodularity benefit from the ability to control architectural innovation while hedging and\nleveraging sustaining incremental innovation rates of modules. Clockspeed boundary\nmodularity acts as a form of value development heijunka.\nIn the realm of value capture, real options have enabled sensitivity to short term\nvariability by providing access to actionable decision points. These decision points allow\nfirms to \"pay to play\" in the midst of intense variability. Although real options are\nsensitive to short term variability, they also are insensitive to long term value capture\nvariation. They decouple short term decisions from the requirement to respond to long\nterm value capture variability. By partitioning this complexity, real options are an\nexample of value capture heijunka.\nThese four examples of heijunka complexity partitioning are extremely effective\ntechniques for evolving complex adaptive systems. They enable lean enterprises to learn\nabout how to improve their business models, products, and production systems while\nminimizing the evolutionary costs. These evolutionary costs come in the form of reduced\nbreakthrough or disruptive projects, abandoned projects in the face of financial\nvariability, lost market segments due to the evolutionary pace of external component\ntechnologies, and worse cost structures from the inability to institute effective learning in\nproduction systems. As a result, enterprises that lack these skills are unable to evolve\nover time in the dynamics of government policy, business cycles, industry structures,\ncorporate strategies, and technology development.\nThus, lean extended enterprises can institute heijunka to partition strategies of\ncomplexity reduction for different types of value.\nValue capture heijunka\nReal options\nValue creation heijunka\nAggregate project planning\nValue development heijunka\nValue delivery heijunka\nDemand leveling (mix & volume)\nClockspeed modularity\nFigure 5.4.3 Heijunka partitions complexity in different domains along the flow of value\n\nThe recognition of simultaneous partitioning strategies along the value flow has been\nrecognized by several peers in the LFM program as a critical component of competitive\nadvantage for lean enterprises. This caused a group of us to develop a symbol for this\nphenomenon. We chose a symbol from the \"Tortoise and the Hare\" story. The group\ncoined the symbol of the \"Tortare\" - a creature that is both fast and hypersensitive in the\nshort term yet slow and insensitive in the long term.\nFigure 5.4.4 The evolution of the \"Tortare\" (Bowers, Rassey, & White, 12)\nThe implications for the theory of the firm are important. Current theories recognize this\nseemingly divergent capability, albeit in different and isolated ways. The Transaction\nCost view recognizes the importance of partitioning in value creation and value capture.\nThe Schumpterian view argues for partitioning value creation. The Dynamic Capabilities\nand Single Mode Evolutionary view primarily acknowledge the importance of\npartitioning value creation. The Hierarchical Evolutionary view is the only view of the\nfirm that appreciates the importance of partitioning value at every stage along its flow.\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\n\nChapter 6: Conclusion\nThe opportunity to work with the Kodak Operating System office was a terrific\nexperience. Partner companies in the Leaders For Manufacturing program should learn\nfrom their gains as a first organizational step towards achieving and institutionalizing\noperational value delivery excellence.\nI hope my insights into evolutionary development of business models, technologies, and\nlean enterprises will provide a first step for a more integrated research agenda. There are\ntwo areas of future research that should be pursued.\nThe first area of future research is the extension of partitioning theory for lean\nenterprises. More partitioning mechanisms must be identified and integrated into an\nevolutionary theory of competitive advantage of the enterprise. Current techniques\nemployed by lean enterprises, like Six Sigma, should be utilized to amplify or reduce\nvariability depending upon the relationship of the application to the enterprise complexity\npartitions. The impact and influence of different stakeholders should also be explained.\nThe second domain of research is genetics. Since this work incorporated theoretical\nprinciples from biology, implications from the completion of the human genome will\nshed further light on complexity partitioning in natural complex adaptive systems. The\nHuman Genome Project found the human genome to consist of 2.9 billion base pairs\n(International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 875). The research discovered\nbase pairs, called \"exons,\" that code for proteins, effectively acting as \"value adding\"\ntemplates that maintain low variability. There are approximately 30,000 base pairs of\n\"exons,\" thus making up only 1.5% of the length of the human genome (Gregory, 18).\nThe remainder of the genome consists of \"junk DNA.\" However, geneticists are\ndiscovering that this remaining DNA is not \"junk\" at all - organisms thrive\nsimultaneously on the amplification of variability in these \"non value-adding\" non-\ncoding regions through architectural recombination. However, they simultaneously rely\nupon simultaneously reducing variability in the \"exon\" regions. In addition to the\ncomplexity partitioning of an individual genome's relative structure, the size of genomes\nacross and within phyla are not correlated with complexity. For instance, salamanders,\nlungfishes, and certain types of protozoa all have larger genomes than humans (Gregory\n17). These natural complex adaptive systems do not use strictly modular systems -\notherwise increases in complexity would be correlated with expansion of the genome.\nNeither do they employ strictly integral systems due to the negative impacts of coupling\nbase pair deletions on selection. Instead, these natural complex adaptive systems\npartition complexity at various levels and interact with higher-level dynamics like cell\ncycles and organism metabolism requirements. These dynamics may provide the key\nanalogy to linking lean enterprise complexity partitioning with higher-level dynamics in\ntechnology, corporate strategy, industry structure, business cycle, and government policy.\n\nAppendix A -

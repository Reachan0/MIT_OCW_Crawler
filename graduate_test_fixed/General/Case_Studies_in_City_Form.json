Selected cities are analyzed, drawn, and compared, to develop a working understanding of urban and architectural form. The development of map making and urban representation is discussed, and use of the computer is required. A special focus is placed on the historical development of the selected cities, especially mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth century periods of expansion. Readings focus on urban design theory in the twentieth century and will be discussed during a weekly seminar on them. This is a methods class for S.M.Arch.S. students in Architecture and Urbanism.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: Two sessions / week, 3 hours / session\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course is intended as an introduction to urban form and design. It is more analytical than synthetic and will concentrate on the physical and social form of the city.\n\nSelected cities will be the subject of this semester's study. The cities will be analyzed, drawn, and compared to other cities in order to develop a working understanding of urban and architectural form (i.e. building and block types, fields, edges, streets, squares, monuments, gardens, etc.).\n\nThe development of map making and urban representation will be discussed, and use of the computer will be required. There will be special focus on the historical development of the city. There will be related required readings on urban design theory in the twentieth century in addition to the individual investigations.\n\nThis course is also open to MCP students with some background in architecture.",

By\nfar the most damaging is the destruction of large old\ncourtyard houses which enables the owner to make\na quick return by selling the sub-divided plots, or to\nachieve more lasting financial gain by building multi-\nstorey blocks of flats. In 1970s a person who pulled\ndown his/her old house and built a new one was ex\nempted from taxation for three years. Intended as an\nincentive to slum clearance, this law has become a seri\nous threat to the heritage. Its effects have been more\nevident in Julfa where land was plentiful and individual\nproperty large. In last three decades, much of this Ar\nmenian quarter has changed in character, its introverted\nand contiguous grain. Nowadays, lock development\ncan be seen everywhere.\nSymptomatics of this change is the fact that inhabit\nants of Julfa having no longer any use for the water\nchannels which irrigated the new unwanted gardens,\ndid nothing to prevent the authorities from diverting\nthe water elsewhere. Today, all the channels are dry and\ngardens which survive barren and ready for the con\ncrete mixer. Another form of residential development\nis the new housing which is everywhere expanding the\nlimits of the city. Invariably, it goes against the tradi\ntion by catering for a European style of life in flats or\ntwo-storey apartments.\nCourtyards admittedly are often appended to new\nhousing blocks as a kind of a buffer space between the\nliving quarters and the street.

The old civic structure was based on a large\norganic square which was called the Old Square. The\norganically shade square was located where the major\nthoroughfares converged in the center of the city. The\nmain routes leading from outside to inside of the city\ntransform major characteristics till now. This formation\nhowever, is a bit different from other Iranian historic\ncities, where no major square is the center of spatial\norganization and the bazaar itself plays this important\nrole. Nevertheless, Isfahan's bazaar remains as one of\nthe best examples of the Eastern bazaars, in terms of\ncharacter, size and architecture.\nIn integration analysis the old square is clearly the\nmost integrated place in the city which coincides the\ngeographical center of the city as well. The high level\nof spatial integration extends from the main square\nthrough different branches of bazaar and reaches the\ngates. The main thoroughfares shape at the same time;\nresidential quarters around them are joined to each oth\ner by some secondary routes.\nThe new square that Shah Abbas made was a copy of\nthis old one. The most important thing about this new\nsquare is not the size, but is the very well-thought and\nwell-designed connection of this new urban space with\nthe older structure of the city. The key point in the de\nsign of this square is linking it with the main chain of\nthe grand bazaar which extends from the old square in\na way that it becomes a part of the overall structure of\nthe city.\nThe other important decision in the new development\nof Isfahan was the new street or Chahar Bagh. Unlike\nmost of the old streets of the old Isfahan, this avenue\nwas a wide, straight boulevard with four rows of large\ntrees and a stream in the middle. But unlike most of the\nHausmann style boulevards in Paris, Chahar Bagh was\nnot cut through the fabric of the city. The street was the\nnorth-south extension of the city toward south where an\nextensive complex of Safavid gardens were created.\nToday, Isfahan still has the old city structure.

      "content": "ISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDesign Proposal\n\nDesign Proposal\nAn urban manifesto: New Approach to Urbanism\nNowadays, cities function in a different way compar\ning to traditional cities. Modernity has changed the\nspatial experience. We cannot deal with urban issues\nlike before. Cities are not self-sustained anymore. Glo\nbalization, global economy, political systems, capital\nism, information technology, economic-space and etc.\nare affecting the city today. Population exploded and\nindustrialization caused fast urban growth. Old tradi\ntional pedestrian ways are not responding to emerging\nuse of cars and so the scale of cities are changing from\na human scale to huge scales. The viability of different\nforms of contemporary urbanism, the changing charac\nter of urban life, the nature and functions of large cities,\nare issues to be considered today. Architects and plan\nners should have a different approach toward \"Urban\nism\".\nUrbanism should take the city toward a well-function-\ning public realm. While studying traditional cities that\nhave strong social interaction and community life, one\ncan learn how a specific design of solids and voids,\nwhich form streets, alleys, squares, plazas and other\nurban elements, can encourage public life. A public\nspace is important because it is not owned by anyone,\nso people can engage in social interaction apart from\ntheir level of wealth or class and it can lead to a more\ndemocratic way of life. Public realm can be approached\nby designing a good network of public spaces and by\nencouraging pedestrianisation by creating a continu\nous network of pedestrian ways. We, as architects often\nthink about creating buildings, but what about creating\na space?\nWhat is essential here is to Study if vertical integra\ntion and horizontal co-ordination are the only ways\nto respond to today's accommodation needs and if it\nhelps or prevents the realization of sustainable neigh\nborhood development and regeneration. Sustainability\nof historic towns and town centers is currently one of\nthe most debatable topics in urban design. Sustainable\ndevelopment in the major cities of the world have fo\ncused on the combination of good planning and meet\ning the overall needs of the community and the ability\nfor developers to work profitably. Can we contribute to\na development that responds to today's needs without\npreventing future generations to meet their own needs?\nStudying the cities, we come up with two kinds of cities.\nA traditional city that has formed organically around a\nhistoric city center and has the usual elements of the\nurban environment and the new model which arises in\ngrowing economic environment of Asia and has formed\nhuge metropolises developed in a short period of time\nand they cannot be analyzed and interpreted like the\ntraditional model.\nIn a successful traditional urban fabric, each building\nfinds its character by engaging in a composition with\nother buildings around it. Monuments do exist at some\npoints, but the beauty emerges from the inter-relation-\nship of solids and the way they interact with spaces they\nsurround. The city is a network, where each element\nexists to complement to urban integration. Materials,\nbuilding orientation, colors, shapes, and function of\neach building is coming form urban fabric and should\ncontribute to it. In modern times, this quality of city has\nchanged and has gone more towards the character of\nthe building itself rather than quality of space.\nThe other important issue about city is the way that\nfunctions interact with each other. The interconnec\ntion of living and activity zones is an important goal. In\nmore interesting urban fabrics, one can see more resi\ndential, commercial, administrative and cultural facili\nties are brought together in close spatial proximity. The\nquality of life will be better by mixed-used functions\nand more social and formal diversity.\nMarket places have a special role in forming a city and\nkeeping it alive. Most of the older cities have shaped\nalong a market place which is also an attractive place\nfor either tourists or local people. Market places nor\nmally start and end in important spots of the city like\nsquares or city hall and they are an idea for expanding\nthe city, if needed, along them.\nStreets and squares have found a more abstract mean\ning in modern mentality. As a modern space needs\nto be, streets are straight, linear and wide. They cre\nate transparency and openness whereas in traditional\nconcept, they create translucency and closure. Squares\nshould have their own individual formal character. They\nshould not be a leftover space between the blocks but\nshould be an independent space with a specific function\nshaping the area around them.\nAlthough we should not aim to re-construct the model\nfor traditional city, we have to challenge the concept\nof isolation that has affected our contemporary cities.\nAlso, we should consider the old concept of public\nspace with attention to scale and pedestrian role and\ninteraction between social levels. The contemporary de\nsign should have contemporary characteristics to leave\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\na footprint for the future. If we want to be a part of the\nhistory of urban integration, we have to find a new ap\npropriate approach towards urbanism.\nWays of implementation\n1. Even a city with a big population growth rate should\nbe managed to grow neighborhood by neighborhood.\nAll major human needs should be provided in walking\ndistance in the neighborhood. Depends on the size of\nthe city, each neighborhood or few of them should have\na community building that increases people's interac\ntion in their city management.\n2. A network of pedestrian walkways should always\nbe provided. This pedestrian network should provide\naccess to all neighborhoods' main spots such as shop\nping areas, schools, governmental offices and etc. a net\nwork of larger streets can provide connections between\nneighborhoods and the each neighborhood with the city\ncenter.\n3. Squares as spaces providing public interaction,\nshould be built in human scale. They should be located\nin each neighborhood and in the city center. While they\nshould be formally inviting, they should be surrounded\nto give a sense of enclosure.\n4. After calculating the population and estimation of\nthe future needs for accommodation with respect to\namount of land available, building codes can be deter\nmined. They should be provided in a way that they can\nincrease density and make a better fabric.\n5. When a city is expanding the most important thing\nis to create a system for this expansion. The urban fab\nric should be continuous and repeatable. By defining\nbuilding codes and density, urban designers can help\nkeep the fabric dense and consistent. Give the guide\nlines to the inhabitants and they will build their city.\n6. Mixed-use functions are the key to social interaction\nand formal diversity.\n7. Public transportation is a must for a well-functioning\ncity. A city that can work without cars, a city with a\ngood public transport system, can enjoy a better envi\nronment, a less polluted weather and healthier citizens.\n9. The relationship between the buildings should be de\ntermined. In the other words, each building should exist\nto contribute to a whole urban form. If monuments are\nto be built, they should be placed in places with more\npublic character and not necessarily in the center.\nIsfahan: Problems and Remedy\nWhen studying Isfahan, the first thing that comes to\nmind is the combination of the old and new and how\nthey survive beside each other. As said before, new\ndevelopments have already ruined some parts of the\nvaluable old districts and the question is how to protect\nthe rest of the city. Looking at Isfahan, the following\nproblems seem to be more of a matter:\n1. Meidan. The Shah square which was the glory of\nthe city today is the major\ntraffic thoroughfare and\nits northern end is used as a parking lot. The modern\ngarden and pool which fill the central area are a western\nimport. They break it up and make it impossible o ap\npreciate its extraordinary scale.\n2. The Khawju bridge is now, car accessed. This makes\nit difficult to preserve it and also the connection be\ntween people and water is declined.\n3. Bazaar as the spine of the city today is not as power\nful as before. It has become mostly a place for tourists\nto visit and buy traditional handicrafts. Chaharbagh and\nother modern streets around (such as Ebn-e-sina and\nAbdolrazzagh streets), in turns have become a center\nfor commercial activities throughout the city and they\nare sucking out the life of the bazaar.\n4. Chaharbagh has lost its spirit, because of the new\nconstructions around it. Also, this happened because of\nthe transformation of the role of this beautiful street.\nBefore it used to connect the gardens with the imperial\npalace. It still has the pedestrian path in the middle but\nthe water channel inside has been filled.\n5. New constructions have taken place during past thir\nty years. They are mostly of very bad building quality\nand design. They are low in density, especially towards\nnorth.\n6. Old neighborhoods such as Julfa have devastatingly\nlost their identity. There is nothing left of their old char\nacter. New constructions have ruined their structure and\nnew roads have cut them in halves.\n7. The connection between the Shah square and Chahar\nBagh is declined in the new developments. Before, in\nShah Abbas era this was the main concept of the Per\nsian gardens around the square. Today, the square and\nthe Chahar Bagh are connected only thorough narrow\nstreets.\n\nConcept of Persian Gardens\nPersian Gardens refers to a tradition and style of gar\nden design which originated in Persia, modern day Iran.\nTraditionally, such gardens would have been enclosed.\nIt is of note that the Persian word for \"enclosed space\"\nwas Pardeiza, which was inherited in Christian mythol\nogy as Paradise on earth, the garden of Eden.\nIts role was, and is, that of relaxation in a variety of\nmanners: spiritual and leisurely (such as meetings with\nfriends), essentially a paradise on earth. The manner in\nwhich the garden is constructed maybe formal (with\nemphasis on structure) or casual (with emphasis on\nplant), and complies to various simple rules govern\ning the design - this is said to allow a maximization, in\nterms of function and emotion, of what may be done in\nthe garden. The origin of the Persian gardens has been\nestimated to go back to 4000 B.C. On the decorated\npottery of that time are found the typical cross plan of\nthe Persian gardens. The Persian concept of an ideal,\nparadise-like garden is perfectly embodied in the Taj\nMahal. It was Babur who introduced the Persian garden\nto India, and the now unkempt Aram Bagh garden in\nAgra was the first of many Persian gardens he created.\nTaj Mahal is one of the largest Persian gardens of the\nworld.\nThe style may be traced to ancient time's centuries\nbefore the Common Era. For example, the outline of\nCyrus I's garden, which adjoined a palace, is still view\nable today - it was built around 500 BCE. During the\nreign of the Sassanids (third to seventh century CE),\nand under the influence of Zoroastrianism, the presence\nof water in art grew to importance - this manifested it\nself as fountains and ponds in gardens.\nDuring the occupations by the Arabs the aesthetic as\npect of the garden increased in importance, overtaking\nthe utility of the garden. During this time the aesthetic\nrules by which the garden is governed grew in impor\ntance - an example of this is the chahar bagh (a form of\ngarden which attempts to emulate Eden - having four\nrivers and four quadrants, representing the world. The\ndesign sometimes involves one axis being longer than\nthe other, water channels often run through the four\ngardens and connect to a central pool.\nThe invasion of Persia by the Mongol Empire in the\nthirteenth century saw an emphasis on highly ornate\nstructure within the Garden, examples of which include\npeonies and chrysanthemums The traditional forms and\nstyle are no longer present among the population of\nIran.\nISFAHAN\nDesign Proposal\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThey may be found in historical sites, museums and\naffixed to the houses of the rich.\nElements\nSun light and its effects were an important factor of\nstructural design in Persian gardens, textures and\nshapes were specifically chosen by architects to harness\nthe light. Due to the latitudinal position of Iran, shade is\nalso incredibly important in the garden, without which\nit could not be a feasibly usable area - trees and trellises\nlargely feature as biotic shade; pavilions and walls are\nalso structurally prominent in blocking the sun.\nAlso related to the heat is the importance of water in\nthe gardens. A form of underground tunnel, below the\nwater table, called a Qanat is used to irrigate water to,\nand around, the garden. Well-like structures then con\nnect to the Qanat, enabling the drawing up of water.\nAlternatively, an animal driven Persian well would be\nused to draw up water to the surface. Such wheel sys\ntems could also be used to move water around surface\nwater systems, such as those which exist in the chahar\nbagh style. Trees were often planted in a ditch called a\nSchool of Madar-e-shah garden\nJub, this prevented water evaporation and allowed the\nwater to quickly access the tree roots.\nThe Persian style often attempts to integrate that which\nis \"indoors\" with the \"outdoors\" - this is often achieved\nthrough the connection of a surrounding garden, with\nan inner courtyard. Between the out and interior were\noften architectural elements such as vaulted arches\nwhich opened up the divide between.\nThe garden has been inextricably tied with Iranian cul\nture since the Emperor Cyrus planted fruit trees at Pas\nargardae, just north of Shiraz. Indeed our word \"Para\ndise\" derives from the Persian word for an enclosed\ngarden. For the formerly nomadic tribes of central Asia,\nthe concept of a permanent place in which flowers and\ntrees were planted to be enjoyed over successive years,\nbecame a powerful symbol.\nThe concept of garden is fundamental to an understand\ning of Shah Abbas I's intention in rebuilding Isfahan.\nThe palaces he built were small since each had a defi\nnite purpose; the entertainment of visitors, the dispen\nsation of justice, but they were linked by gardens set\nout along his great central avenue, Chahar Bagh (or\nfour gardens).\nThere are few gardens left today in Isfahan but ev\nery house has its own miniature enclosure which will\nnormally include some shade and a small pool around\nwhich people may gather when the weather permits.\nChehel Sotun, Garden in Isfahan\n\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSafavid plan for the gardens\n\nThe Design Proposal\nThe cultural and historical axis of Isfahan in fact acts\nas the core of the city. This axis begins from the Friday\nmosque and old square, which forms the Seljukid city\ncenter and runs up to the location of Bagh-e-Hezar Ja\nrib of Safavid period, in place of which today's Isfahan\nUniversity stands.\nThis axis passes across Bazaar, the complex of the\nSquare, City's heart in Safavid period, and Char Bagh.\nThe historical axis that has evolved during a period\nof more than 1000 years has always acted as the main\nstructure of the city and comprises examples of archi\ntecture and urban planning of all different periods of\nIsfahan history.\nThe new urban plan of the city ensures the identity, in\nternal congruity, homogeneity and functional efficiency\nof this axis in compliance with Isfahan's architecture\nand urban values and will serve as Isfahan's main struc\nture in the future.\nDistrict \"3\" covers a large part of Isfahan's historic\ncenter. This historic region has a unique coherent urban\nfabric and structure. The detailed plan for district\"3\"\nattempts to enhance this quality by defining a frame\nwork that stems from the unique characteristics of the\nhistoric region and that adheres to the principals and\nguild lines of the master plan, that concern to these\ncharacteristics.\nThe historic zone of Isfahan that includes the old part\nof the city, not only embodies a large number of valu\nable historic architectural works- some of which inter\nnationally known- but also is prominent from esthetics\npoint of view, for the way it functions and for its well-\nshaped urban structure. The urban skeleton of the zone\nis so robust that despite all the ignorance and harm that\nit has been subject to, is still functioning and the present\nday Isfahan, with millions of inhabitants, still relies on\nthis old structure.\nThe design proposal is to find a connection between the\nShah square and Chahar Bagh in connection with the\nconcept of Persian gardens which once exist and where\nthe glory of the city. The other attempt is done to protect\nthe Shah square from being car-accessed and function\ning as a parking garage in the north side. The streets to\nthe Shah square should not bring the cars in. In return,\npeople can use the public transport or the other parking\ngarages that exist near the square.\nISFAHAN\nDesign Proposal\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSketch showing the main pathways that are car-accessed in the present day Isfahan.\n\n750M\nDesign Proposal\nSketch showing the proposed movement system for the Shah square and new open space.\n\nthe proposed movement system for the Shah square and new open space.\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n3HAH3QUARE\n0ROPOSED'ARDEN\n#AR!CCESS\n!LI1APU#ASTLE\n%XISITING)MPERIAL\"UILDING\n%XISITING)MPERIAL\"UILDING\n%XISITNG0ARKING\n0EDESTRIAN!CCESS\nDiagram showing\n\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDesign Proposal\nThe design proposal\n\nBibliography\nSajjadi, Amad.

It focuses more clearly on the com\nponents of the modern city (admixtures), and how\nthey can be responsibility integrated into the city\nplan. These 'extra' ingredients are not required\nfor a good city, but seem to continually surface in\nour contemporary city. This manifesto is an at\ntempt to integrate these elements into the previous\nrecipe and revisit the methodology to assembling\nthe elements within the city. Once again, the\nunderlying goal is to promote social interaction\n(community) and understanding within the city.\nThe Modern City. Preamble.\nIt is quite peculiar that designers have many great\ncities around the world, yet still cannot build a\ngood city today. Although many of the great clas\nsical cities in the world grew and developed over\ntime, we should still be able to design the base\ninfrastructure for this process to transpire. The\nfollowing ingredients are a few reoccurring ele\nments in contemporary cities, that seem to be part\nof the reason of why we can no longer resurrect\nproven (working) city types. Perhaps, if we al\nlow these elements to enter the argument, we can\ndefine how they should be incorporated responsi\nbility into a city. There are several elements that\nwe could discuss in the modern city; the ones pre\nsented below are what I feel to be the most crucial\nto investigate.\nAdmixtures.\nThe Tower and (not) Free Space. Most cities\nhave at least a few towers as a symbol of their\ninnovation and/or identity. Just like any building\n(besides the monument), the tower needs to be in\ntegrated into the fabric of the city. This involves\nsplitting the tower into two components - a hori\nzontal base and a vertical sliver. The horizontal\nbase does not need to mimic the style or materials\nof the fabric, but should have a rhythm and scale\nrelating to its surroundings, while being built to\nthe block edge. The towers looming above should\nbe set back from the base to offset their large pres\nence. In all cases, towers should be strategically\npositioned to not throw a significant shadow onto\npublic spaces or animated streets. For this reason,\npoint towers are a favored type - as their small\nfootprint usually ranges from 40 - 60 m in each\ndirection. Lastly, towers should contain the same\ndiversity and density as the city below. Imagine\nwalking down a block with continuously consis\ntent housing - no stores, parks, or public institu\ntions to break this homogeneity. A tower could\nsuffer the same mundane fate, and should there\nfore be programmed with diverse activities and\nspaces. All of the public program and space with\nin the tower should be available to all, to avoid\nhierarchies within the city and promote a rich\ncommunity. This 'verti-city' should be planned\n(perhaps with the same ingredients of a 'good\ncity') as 'free space' was really 'generic space'\nand offered more confusion and emptiness than\nfreedom. Ultimately, the tower could be used as\nan element to promote social interaction within\nthe city, but should not be regarded as replacing\nthe city.\nThe Park. The park has been a great achieve\nment as well as a failure in many contemporary\ncities. For parks to be successful they need to be\nlarge enough to seem natural (i.e. not a square),\nyet small enough to create tangible spaces. This is\nnot to say that you cannot have grand parks within\na city - they must, however, be treated as separate\n'rooms' tied together. This can be achieved with\na differentiation in typography, speed (places of\nmovement and places of pause), ground materi\nals, and the use of different elements (water, trees,\nshrubs). It is difficult to attribute a typical size\nfor a good park, as it is largely dependent on the\nability to produce differentiation within the space\nas well as the scale and speed of the surround\ning city. Park 'rooms' however, should be in the\nrange of 120 - 150m in each direction. A mod\nest sized park could be around 500 x 500m, al\nlowing for several smaller spaces within. Lastly,\nparks should be placed in animated zones within\nthe city, and fronted with sufficient public build\nings to ensure their use. At night, they should be\nproperly illuminated to allow for continuous in\nhabitation.\nThe Highway, The Car, and Parking. The car\nand the highway have become a part of, and have\nhad a devastating effect on contemporary cities,\nand we must hypothesize how they can be syn\nthesized into the urban fabric. Ideally, highways\nwould be placed underground in all cities. This\nis preferred over raising them to allow the city\nto run below. If the highway cannot be buried,\ntheir points of entry into the city should be lim\nited. Also, if the bridge solution is opted for,\nthese should not be more than 15-20m in width\nwithout causing a psychological barrier. Another\noption is to raise the highway even further off the\nstreet, to psychologically separate it from the ur\nban realm below and also more light to penetrate\ndown onto the street. Within the city, the primary\nroads should separate the larger neighborhoods,\nand secondary roads should be used for local traf\nfic within each neighborhood . Parking should\nbe located underground at highway exits, as each\nexit should correspond to a large neighborhood or\ndistrict center. If parking needs to be located on\nthe surface, it should be contained in a parking\ndeck that is scaled to and integrated in the sur\nrounding fabric.\nSprawling Distances. The city has inevitably\ngrown larger due to the use of the car. A couple of\nthings to consider when accounting for 'sprawl'\n. The problem with sprawl is that it implies an\norigin or center. When the city sprawls from the\ncenter, it often neglects to provide the amenities\nof the center to the surrounding neighborhoods.\nWhen these neighborhoods or districts become\nself-sufficient, they have no real public space or\ninstitutions. Therefore, we must treat each neigh\nborhood or district like a small city, and provide\nit with all the ingredients of a good city on a re\nduced scale. Secondly, we must split up the city\ninto neighborhoods that are conceivable on the\nhuman scale (about 1.5 km x 1.5 km). Primary\nroads can run around and connect these neighbor\nhoods to one another, but the internal structure of\neach area is primarily pedestrian based. Despite\nthe large scale of any city, the pedestrian should\nfind a conceivable sense of place and scale within\nthese neighborhoods/ districts. Lastly, regardless\nof distances from the core, all new areas must be\nbuilt to specifications in 'What Makes a Good\nCity?' to avoid suburban \"communities\".\nNew Infrastructures. New infrastructures such\nas WIFI, cell phone transmitters within subways,\nvideo internet stations, etc. should be incorporat\ned into the city and allow access for all citizens.\nThese can be used to animate public space, and\npull inhabitants outside the private realm.\nIndoor Shopping Mall. The primary problem\nof the indoor shopping mall is its immense scale,\nand the lack of dialogue with the surrounding\nfabric (they internalize themselves). The indoor\nshopping mall has obvious benefits over the exte\nrior market, but it also has some crucial elements\nthat must be detailed properly in the contempo\nrary city. The shopping mall should be public\n- the streets should be opened to all, and be used\nin any manner the public sees fit. These streets\n\nALEXANDRIA\nMANIFESTO\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nshould be open 24 hours a day to allow the mall\nto be used as a public space in off hours (hence,\nconsumption is secondary and public space is\nprimary). The mall should take its scale (width\nof the street and height) from the surrounding\nfabric. Furthermore, the mall should mix its pro\ngram to allow for a variety of public spaces within\nthe street, and perhaps offices above. If the sur\nrounding fabric dictates that a mall should be 3\nstoreys, shopping should only be located along\ngrade. Two or more storey shopping malls should\nbe avoided as they pull pedestrians off the street\nlevel and into an establishment. Lastly, the mall\nmust interact with both its internal street and its\nedges. In a double loaded mall, stores should be\nfacing onto two streets (the interior and exterior\nstreet), to offer two diverse experiences to the pe\ndestrian. Perhaps the best precedent available is\nthe Galleria in Milan.\nIconic Monuments. These seem to provide a\nsense of identity or collective vision to the con\ntemporary city. In general, although it is their aim\nto be disparate from the fabric, they should create\nspace, and not leave residual public space. Lastly,\nthere should be some long term thinking of how\nthey are placed and if their symbol will endure\n(as this will psychologically effect the use of the\nspace). I will return to this at some point during\nmy thesis.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Pick a site tied to a natural artifact that offers a\nsense of place.\n2. Estimate direction and density of present in\nhabitation and future growth.\n3. Layout the public spaces associated with the\nnatural artifact, and have these 'bleed' out into\ngrowth estimate areas.\n4. Locate the urban artifact/ monuments, and dis\nperse these throughout the city (again, based on\nestimates)\n5. Cut the 2-4 lane highways and subway system\nunderground. The placement and direction of\nthe subway lines must work in conjunction with\npredicted growth patterns and the location of the\nurban artifacts (& their associated squares). High\nways, particularly, can be placed early in the pro\ncess as they are partially rooted in connection to\nother cities (which we will assumed are defined),\nand therefore we only need to understand their\nentrance points and exit ramps. Large parking\ndecks should be place underground at this point\nas well.\n6. Place the primary public squares where the\nurban artifacts encounter infrastructure. These\nshould be distributed throughout the city fabric.\nThese are the centers around which the fabric is\ndraped.\n7. Layout 'neighborhoods' or 'districts' tied to the\npublic spaces. This will be used to set up the pri\nmary street structure.\n8. Create primary streets (2-4 lane roads) related\nto the block size of each district. Set up a hier\narchy between urban cores, which are tied to\nmain roads, and neighborhood cores (secondary\nsquares), which are tied to smaller roads. Avoid\noverspecialized in districts; try to keep the com\nponents evenly distributed within the fabric.\n9. Place the secondary streets (1 lane or pedes\ntrian) within the smaller fabric unit. These should\nbe connected to primary streets as well as second\nary squares.\n10. Locate commercial and public functions along\ngrade to animate the street and increase social in\nteraction.\n11. Distribute the offices and residential units\nwithin the fabric. Keep these within walking\ndistance and not always separate. Mix different\ntypes of commerce and social-economic classes\nto promote diversity within each district. This can\nbe achieved by having a neighborhood center on\nthe intersection point of 4 neighborhoods, as op\nposed to the center of each individual neighbor\nhood.\n12. If admixtures need to be added, insert based\non guidelines above.\n13. Voila! A good city ...\n\nASSESSMENT OF URBAN PROBLEMS\nALEXANDRIA\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nAn Assessment of Urban Problems.\nBuilding too Fast. The rapid expansion of post\nWorld War II Alexandria has destroyed a large\npart of urban life that existed during the late 19th\ncentury city. Newer buildings are driven primar\nily through economic and ideological forces. Ec\nonomically, buildings are grossly oversized and\nare fabricated of cheap materials. Ideologically,\nnewer buildings are meant to be 'modern' - which\nessentially translates to 'taller'. Both forces have\ngiven little consideration to the ground plane of\nthe projects. Furthermore, new development is\noccurring so rapidly it does not seem to be part\nof a larger urban vision. Lastly, because there is\nlittle time between the materialization of urban\nprojects, there is hardly time to assess and critique\ntheir successes (and failures).\nWanting Recognition from the Western World.\nThis is perhaps more of an ideological problem\nwithin the city, but it has affected the choice of\nurban projects. The primary example of this is\nthe New Bibliotheca Alexandria, which is rooted\nperhaps more in generic symbology than contex\ntualism within the site. In essence, Alexandria is\ntrying to import identity related to the Western\nworld, as opposed to searching for and revealing\ntheir own eclectic identity. There has always been\na large draw from the Western world to Alexan\ndria. It is interesting to note that after gaining 'in\ndependence', they are still taking on urban proj\nects to attract and relate to the Western World.\nLack of Structured Public Squares. The pri\nmary public squares do not offer enough enclo\nsure. Not only are the surrounding buildings too\nlarge (in plan), they are all separated by streets.\nAnother problem with the public spaces is their\nlarge provision for traffic and parking. Both Saad\nZaghloul and Al Tahrir Square have large surface\nparking lots adjacent to the greens of the square.\nThe oversized roads that encompass the square\nseparate the buildings from the 'public space'.\nThis leaves the public space largely open to the\nsun, making it quite unpleasant to linger within\nthe square during a large portion of the year. Last\nly, the squares are covered in grass, which seems\nquite foreign to the climate and the city. While\nthis makes the square seem special, it also creates\na level of formality with contributes to its empti\nness.\nPublic Spaces are Separated from Buildings.\nAll of the major squares and public spaces are sig\nnificantly separated from their adjacent buildings.\nThe squares are all lined with 3-5 laned roads that\neffectively render the public space as the residual\nspace of a roundabout. The beach and harbor are\nseparated from the city due to the 6 laned Cor\nniche. This 'highway' essentially creates a public\nzone to one side of the road that has access to the\nharbor, and a separated commercial zone (cafes,\nrestaurants, etc.) that inhabits the ground level of\nthe buildings. The primary dilemma in this is that\nit is difficult to animate spaces effectively without\nthis connection. Buildings ensure people, and to\nhave them connect directly to public spaces will\nresult in more (or a higher probability of) activity\nwithin the public space.\nThe City belongs to the Car - Too many wide\nroads and too much parking. Not only does the\nCorniche and several roads that line the perimeter\nof the major squares seem to wide, other roads\nwithin the city are disproportionate to the build\ning programs that line their edges. For instance,\nHorreya Street becomes an 8 laned street, when\nit ventures to the western (newer) part of the city.\nThe street is predominately ruled by the car, leav\ning the pedestrian urban realm as a secondary\nspace. Moreover, the distance between the build\nings is also too large and there is not a sufficient\namount of program to create a structured edge.\nThis 'openness' relates to the speed of movement\nin the car, but is too large (and mundane) to walk\nthrough.\nLack of dialogue between the old and new.\nThere is a lack of nostalgia for Ancient Alexan\ndria, and many of the 'ruins' sites are clumsily\nhandled throughout the city. For the most part,\nthese are plots of void occurring quite randomly\nthroughout the city. Although they have mar\nketed these as tourist attractions, beyond this,\nthere is little relationship between the old and the\nnew. Developments occurring along these areas\ncould be more responsive to this ancient context.\nMoreover, significant open (but structured) spac\nes could be developed around these sites to evoke\na dialogue between the two cities.\nFabric > Stand Alone Fabric > Stand Alone.\nNew buildings are being made larger and more\nseparate from the fabric. There does not seem\nto be a master plan or vision for how these are\nhandled. Essentially these have little relation to\nthe ground plane, and create a monotonous block\nedge for the pedestrian.\nIsolated Functions. The city is essentially com\nprised of districts (i.e. Residential, Commerce,\nBeach, etc.) that could be more interactive. The\nseparation of functions animates certain parts\nof the city at certain times of the day, but leaves\nthese areas empty at others. If there was more\nmixed used buildings within Alexandria, there\nwould perhaps be more interaction between dif\nferent socio-economic residents within the city,\nand continuous life throughout the city at all\ntimes of the day.\nCivic Structure need mores Structure. The\nEastern portion of the civic structure begins to\nfall apart. The shallat gardens could be better\nused to connect the university, library and Hor\nreya Street. Furthermore, the connection between\nthe shallat gardens and the train station could be\nstrengthened by denisifying the street edge. The\npark could also be less defined and spill out into\nthe city, providing more linkage and therefore\ncreating more inhabitation.\n\nALEXANDRIA\nPROJECT PROPOSAL\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nProject Proposal.\nIssues.\n- The link to the University Alexandria (to the\nsouth) is quite superficial.

The conceptual\nstudies on the previous page explore different op\ntions to connect the pedestrians from the city to\nthe sea.

Essentially this creates two terraces which\ncan be animated in different manners. The top\nterrace is largely animated by the buildings along\nthe cornice and market stalls.

Whatever the truth may be, it is clear\nthat they had come to Isfahan long before the foun-\ndation of Jayy. It is in the story that they called the\narea \"Ashkahan\" which in their language means \"We\nstopped here\". It was then an uncultivated land.\nAbout the architecture of Jayy, it is said that there was\na fire temple around it. It is significant that the fire tem-\nple was not located within the walls of Jayy and it was\noutside. Jayy was never intended to be a religious city.\nWhen Muslim Arabs conquered Jayy, they built their\nfirst mosque within the walls of Jayy, in a noble's house\nwhich was not a good idea because Jayy was used\nmostly as a refugee camp and it didn't have a\ntrue urban population.

It is\ngenerally believed that during the first Islamic century\nIsfahan consisted of twin cities, Jayy and Yahoudieh,\nwhich were separated with a small distance. The com\ning of Islam to the region of Isfahan seems to have\nhad little impact until the Abassid period. In 767-68 an\nAbassid governor set up residence between Jayy and\nYahoudieh, in the village called Khushinan, and he\nbuilt a mosque on the site of the present Shaya mosque.\nThe Abassid governor also established markets toward\nYahoudieh.\nAfter the Abassid governor was removed, In 772-73\nA.D.

The new\nadministration opted for Yahoudieh and extended its\njurisdiction over fifteen other villages. Most of these\nvillages became quarters of the city and retained their\nancient names even until very recently.

Also,\nthere have been a series of major arteries within\nquarter, radiating from the center point of the city\nward toward the gates in the city walls. A traveler,\ner khosrow, that visited Isfahan in eleventh century\nimpressed by the multiplicity of walls and gates\nmakes the statement that every bazaar had a wall and\nstrong gate likewise all the alleys and districts.\nThe administrative center of the city remained within\nthe Buyid walls even till recent times. The suburbs\nhad a role to play. The suburbs were in three different\nareas:\n-The area south of the river (Julfa).\n-The north bank of the city.\n-The area to the northeast of the walled\nAttention: surprisingly the direction of the Shah square\ndistricts such as Baraan were included.\nAfter Abassid period, the Buyids took over and the\nnext important developments took place under them.\nThey encircled part of the city with a defensive wall\nincluding twelve gates and built a strong citadel in\nthe southwest corner. The exact date of the wall is not\nknown, but Moghaddasi (A historian) writing in 985\nA.D. describes Isfahan as a walled city. The course of\nthis wall is particularly visible in a series of streets en\ncircling the eastern part of the modern city. Soon after\nthe walling of the city the roughly oval area inside was\ndivided into four different quarters:\n-Juybareh which is still a well-known designation for\nthe northeast quadrant of the city, corresponding to the\nancient settlement of Yahoudieh.\n- Karaan which occupied the southeast quadrant.\n- Dardasht which covered the large area of the northwest\nquadrant and was also divided into several districts.\n- Kushk which is the remaining southwest quadrant of\nthe walled city, which eventually became the Safavid\nquarter of government.\nThe four, roughly pie shaped quarters constitute quad\nrants of a circle or oval. The center where these quad\nrants meet is an area right in the south of the Friday\nmosque which now is called \"The old square\". Although\nwe do not know when this old square was built.\nEven through the period of twin cities, urban life\nconcentrated north of the river. Until seventeenth\ntury, the area south of the river was never a concern.\nPerhaps all along it have been the province of\nMuslim minorities. However, the north shore of\nriver was always occupied by the royal palaces\naristocratic estates taking advantage of the waterfront\nlocation. Concerning the area north of the walled\nit is difficult to know whether there had been some\nvelopment before sixteenth century or not. This\nknown as Bidabad, was a place for squatters and\nlarge cemeteries. In fourteenth century it was known\nbe place of paupers. All the agricultural land and\ndens, located outside of the walled city to the south\nwest the Safavids, eventually incorporated into the\nof their metropolis.\nIf we count only the monuments that lie within\nactual city of Isfahan, the number remaining from\nearly period is small: one or two Buyid remains, some\neight Seljuk structures, eight Mongol buildings,\nfive Timurid ones.\n\nHistoric Development-Seljukid Era\nThe Friday Mosque, Plan Today\nThe Friday Mosque\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSeljukid Isfahan- 10th and 11th centuries\nSeljuk is the chieftain of a group of Turkish tribes, who\nmigrate, in the late 10th century, from the steppes to the\nnorthern borders of the Persian Empire - in the region\naround the Syr-Darya River. They embrace Islam, and\nare expected to play their part in the frontier defenses of\nthe Muslim world. But in the recurrent pattern of barbar\nians in the suburbs of civilization, they have their own\nideas. They fancy a more central position. The Seljuks\nestablish their base in this border region between mod\nern Iran and Afghanistan, in Isfahan. So, Isfahan be\ncame the capital of Persia for the first time. During this\nperiod, the centre of power within the Islamic world\nshifted from the Arab territories to Anatolia and Iran,\nwith the traditional centers now residing in the Seljuk\ncapitals - Merv, Nishapur, Rayy and Isfahan.\nA uniquely Iranian, eastern Islamic, architecture\nemerges only in the 11th and 12th centuries with the\narrival in Iran of the Seljuk Turks. The Seljuks implant\ned creative and bold structural ideas in Iran, as well\nas new spatial concepts, which would later serve as a\nfoundation for Safavid architectural developments. The\nSeljuks replaced the traditional western Islamic hypo\nstyle mosque layout (brought to Iran in 749 by its first\nIslamic rulers, the Arab Abbasids) with the four-iwan\nplan. The Seljuk Turks excelled in the design of very\nlarge vaulted spaces and in the decorative articulation of\nbuildings inside and out using complex brick patterns.\nThey also promoted the custom of organizing impor\ntant urban buildings around an open square(maidan), a\nlarge rectangular piazza or town square. Most of these\ndesign schema were unknown or eschewed in the Is\nlamic west.\nWhen the Seljuks took Isfahan as their capital, they\ntransformed a pre-existing hypostyle mosque into the\ngrand four-iwan Great Friday Mosque (Masjid-i Jami).\nAn iwan is a vast vaulted space open at one end. It was\na symbol of absolutist authority dating back to pre-Is-\nlamic Persia, when iwans functioned as audience halls\nin royal palaces. Iwans were also known in Islamic pal\naces, but it was the Seljuks who introduced the iwan\ninto mosque architecture. The introduction of a symbol\nof royal prerogatives into mosque architecture encour\naged the viewer to associate earthly rule with divine au\nthority. The Great Friday Mosque has four iwans, one\ncentered in each of the courtyard's four sides. Thereaf\nter, this four-iwan plan became the dominant mosque\ntype in eastern Islamic lands.\nBuildings earlier than 1500 A.D. in Isfahan.\nIsfahan: Safavid Era\n\nHistoric Development-Seljukid Era\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThe area of old Friday mosque which has vanished\nduring times\nThe Friday mosque\nof the Great Friday mosque.\nThe Friday Mosque today, where there's no remains of the old square.\nout of medieval Isfahan.

In 1244\nthe city was captured by Mongols. In Mongol times,\nIsfahan was a provincial capital and its economy was\nstill prosperous although more modest than Seljukid\nera. After the decline of the Mongols in the second\nhalf of the fourteenth century, the Iranian Muzaffarids,\nruled over Isfahan. The Muzaffarid period in Isfahan is\nchiefly remarkable for the Minarets of Dardasht and the\ntomb of Lady Soltan Bakht Agha.\nThe year 1387 marks the end of an almost 800 year\nlong period of prosperity for Isfahan in Islamic times.\nIn this year, Timur conquered the city and ordered his\nsoldiers to sack it. A lot of its inhabitants were killed.\nIn 1414, Isfahan was reported to have had only 50,000\ninhabitants. The Tomb of Shahshahan dates from this\nperiod as does some of the work on the principal iwan\nThe Seljuk period of Isfahan is also important because\nit was the first time in the history of Isfahan's urban de\nvelopment that the city found a civic structure. Seljuks\nneeded a governmental structure for their capital so\nthey added to the Friday mosque which remained from\nolder times and shaped the city center around it. The\nold square of the city was structured at this time. It be\ncame the administrative and religious center of Isfahan\nand remained as the city center until the sixteenth cen\ntury when a new square was built by The Safavid king,\nAbbas.\nToday, it is still evident that the main axis of intra-ur-\nban communication of the pre-motorized age converg\nes from the periphery of the city on the magnet of the\nSeljuk square.\nThe Old Square\nThe old square is a very important element in the lay-\nin ruins condition.\nder of the old square.\neast border of old square.\n\nISFAHAN\nHistoric Development-Seljukid & Timurid Era\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThe medieval City Structure\nThe main axes of intra-urban communication were\nthose of the Middle Ages, for if they were more recent,\nthey would not converge onto the old but onto the new\nsquare. N the tenth century wall the most important of\nthe city gates were situated along these axes. Although\nlocating the exact city gates is difficult since already in\nseventeenth century the medieval city gates had no lon\nger had any function. The city had grown beyond me\ndieval walls and Safavids did not defend their empire at\nthe city gates of their capital but at its extreme borders,\nbe they in central Asia or Iraq. The four main axes of\nthe city are still lined for long stretches with shops and\nworkshops, forming the bazaar of the city.\nThe paths or bazaar located on the north and northwest,\nare preserved and still exist. The road running from the\nwest gate in a northeastern direction became aftre1600,\npart of the main bazaar axis. It was joined by a street\nthat came from the south gate which around the year\n1000 lay close to the intersection of the two, but which\nin pre-Safavid times was located further to the south.\nThere is no recognizable road leading from the old\nsquare towards the southeast. There are two possible\nreasons: Either everything was destroyed in late me\ndieval times, or the density of population between the\nold square and the city palace was low that no road was\nneeded.\nThrough the determination of the main routes of intra-\nurban communication and their intersection point, the\nold square, all those parts of the medieval city which\nformed its skeleton are isolated. Here originated the\ncentral bazaar area around the old square to whose\ncommercial importance and cosmopolitan flair literary\nsources bear witness. In addition to these, small ba\nzaars formed near city gates and along the axes there\nwere linear bazaars as well. In one of them a traveler\nin eleventh century saw no fewer than fifty carevansa\nrais. Around the administrative, religious, intellectual\nand commercial center at the old square and the main\naxis of the intra-urban communications system, there\nwere the residential quarters with their sub-centers and\nsecondary religious buildings.\nBuildings existing from this era are located in or near\nthe original Yahudieh on the north of the old square,\nwhich shows that this area was the nucleus of the city.\nWith its twisted lanes, its high density and small lots, it\nresisted even the most trying periods of crisis.\nThe main axis of intra-urban communication in Seljukid Isfahan\nSeljuks were famous for building minarets.

They established Shiite Islam\nas the state religion, promoted Sufism, and instituted\nstate capitalism to support wide-ranging political and\nsocial goals. Commerce was so important to the Safa\nvid polity that its most powerful dynasty, Shah Abbas I,\neffectively re-routed the Silk Road through Isfahan so\nthat his empire would enjoy a trading monopoly. By the\nseventeenth century, Isfahan attracted not only Europe\nan merchants but also missionaries and mercenaries, as\nit became a religiously tolerant hub of mercantile and\ndiplomatic activity. The city fabric is significant as an\nembodiment of this religious, commercial, and political\nunity, and was exceptional in the early modern Islamic\nworld.\nSafavid Dynasty\nIshmail I (1501-1524)\nTahmasb I (1524-1576)\nIshmail II (1576-1577)\nChodabende I (1578-1588)\nAbbas I (1588-1629)\nSafi I (1629-1642)\nAbbas II (1642-1666)\nSafi II (Suleiman) (1666-1694)\nSoltan Husain (1694-1722)\nTahmasb II (1722-1732)\nAbbas III (1732-1736)\nIsfahan did not become the capital of Iran until the\ntimes of Shah Abbas I. It was partly because of the\nfights between Safavids and Ottoman Turks. And this\nwas Safavids main problem that faces Ismail and his\nsuccessors for about a century. That is why during Shah\nTahmasbI the capital was located in Qazvin which was\nfarther to Ottoman borders than Isfahan. Some kind of\npeace was established in 1555 with Ottomans. After\nshah Tahmasb a short period of chaos appeared, the\ncivil war broke out, the Turks invaded Tabriz again. In\n1587 Khorasan proclaimed Shah Abbas I.\nThe first Safavid kings integrated their buildings into\nthe medieval plan of Isfahan and their main concern\nwas reconstruction of the old square.\nIsfahan, the Safavid Capital\nNearly four centuries after the fall of the Seljuks, in\nwinter of 1587, Shah Abbas I transferred his capital\nfrom Qazvin to Isfahan. This decision brought Isfahan\nin the course of only a few years to the highest point\nof its development and made it a capital of interconti\nnental importance, where envoys and merchants from\nEurope met those from the Far East.\nInitially, Abbas did little to alter the physical appear\nance of Isfahan, preferring merely to associate his reign\nwith pre-existing symbols of authority. He established\nhis royal palace on the old maidan (city square) near the\nGreat Friday Mosque, a legacy of Seljuk rule. Under\nstandably concerned with preparing the foundations for\nthe city's infrastructure, Abbas rebuilt and refurbished\nold bazaars and laid some foundations for new shops.\nHe did not neglect the emperor's duty of providing pub\nlic entertainments. He leveled the old square and spread\nsand on it so that it could be used for polo, horse racing,\nand wine drinking.\nWhen restoring Seljuk buildings, Abbas left the Sa\nfavid mark in an unmistakable yet respectful manner.\nHis renovation of the Great Friday Mosque, for in\nstance, visually accentuated the features most associ\nated with imperial authority using the brilliant colored\ntiles favored by Persian architects. He focused on the\nmosque's iwans and courtyard which he had sheathed\nin polychromatic patterned tile veneer. The iwan vaults\nwere elaborated with muqarnas (applied ornament\nwhich looks like stalactites or honeycombs) to which\nglazed mosaic tile was applied. Two minarets were\nadded to the main iwan and clad with colored tiles, cre\nating a new iconographic symbol of authority in which\nthe new (twin minarets) was grafted onto the old. In\ngeneral, Abbas demonstrated sensitive, if self-serving,\nreverence for Isfahan's glorious past and concern for its\nfitting display.\nUnlike other kings that had ruled Isfahan and had\nsometimes lived in the old city, Shah Abbas decided\nnot to live in the old city at all. He built his court on the\nsouthwestern edge of the city of those days. In this he\nfollowed trends already known in Seljuk architecture\nthat is, to build royal components near the river. Abbas\nwent further, however, and created a new religious and\neconomic center at the fringe of the sixteenth century\ncity. He thus, forced further development of Isfahan\ninto new directions.\nOld city structure in Safavid era\nDetail of entrance portal Muqarnas work in Shah mosque\nShah Abbas the great, Safavid king.\n\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nHistoric Development-Shah Abbas City\nThe New City Plan -- Embodiment of Safavid\nIdeology\nThe Safavid monuments for which Isfahan is famous\nwere commissioned by Abbas I after 1602. Military vic\ntories between the years 1590 and 1602 had confirmed\nAbbas's capacity as an empire builder. More capital and\nlabor were put into bridges, roads, and caravanserais\nto build and facilitate trade. Abbas I was now ready to\nsupplant the city's past and construct a pristine arena of\nSafavid rule outside the historic center. He established\nhis \"new city\" in Isfahan to the south of the old city\ncenter, to which he transferred the imperial household;\nmerchants and artisans relocated there as well. In the\ndesign of the new city, Abbas mobilized certain ele\nments of the architectural past to generate a new Ira\nnian imperial identity in the name of Safavid religious,\ncommercial, and political ideals.\nThe grand scale and inorganic mathematical order of\nthe new city implied that the values embodied in the old\ncapital had been surpassed and supplanted by Abbas's\npriorities: religious tolerance, capitalism, state Shiism,\nSufi reverence for saintly teachers and concern for the\nwelfare of the masses. The new maidan turned its back\non the old center, creating instead an alignment with the\nnew Chahar Bagh Avenue (1596-1602) and the multi-\nethnic, multi-faith sacred sites and suburbs south of the\nZayandeh River. The latter included Hindu cremation\nplatforms, a Zoroastrian cemetery, and the suburbs of\nNew Julfa (for silk-trading Christian Armenians) and\nAbbasabad Chahar Bagh (for Tabrizi war refugees).\nMany new bridges were built linking the northern city\nwith the southern suburbs.. Operable flood gates on the\nlower level of the Khwaju Bridge (1650-51) celebrated\nSafavid technological control of nature, while on the\nupper level social amenities such as a promenade and\npavilions invited passers-by to linger and enjoy the view\nof the river -- source of the city's pleasure and prosper\nity. By designing the avenue, bridges, and streets of the\nsuburbs in alignment with the orthogonal layout of new\ncity, the designers succeeded in embedding Abbas's\nideology inescapably into the fabric of urban life.\nThe Safavid map for the city\n\nHistoric Development-Shah Abbas City\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nChahar Bagh: the new European style street of Isfahan\nKhawju: One of several bridges that Shah Abbas made to connect north and south of the river\nShah Square\nThe center of the new city was a magnificent new\nsquare(510 x 158 meters) exultantly called the \"Design\nof the World\" Maidan (Maidan-i Naqsh-i Jahan). Its\ndesign united all of the facets of the Safavid polity into\none spatial diagram: worship (the Shah Mosque), com\nmemoration (the Mosque of Sheikh Lutfallah), sov\nereign administration (the Imperial Palace), and trade\n(Qaisariya Bazaar).\nAbbas I's designers differentiated the new city from the\nold historical center by organizing the street patterns on\northogonal grids not oriented toward Mecca. The old\ncity had narrow winding streets and the old maidan was\noriented toward Mecca. The old and new maidans were\nconnected by the winding covered street of the Great\nBazaar (2 km long) covered by high stone and brick\nvaults by the order of Abbas I. English and Dutch trad\ners lived near the bazaar, as Isfahan was home to one of\nthe East India Company's warehouses. Where the Great\nBazaar met the new maidan, a group of buildings was\nbuilt that constituted the Qaisariya Bazaar (Imperial\nBazaar--built and maintained by the emperor). They\nhoused imperial manufactures (wholesale silks and fine\nartisans' dwellings.\nThe Imperial Palace was a garden palace complex, a\npalace type with a long history in Islamic architecture.\nThis palace was composed of elaborate independent\npavilions set in the garden, such as the Chihil Sutun,\nwhich served as audience chambers, banqueting halls\nwhich served as audience chambers, banqueting halls,\nand residential apartments for the royal family.

The Impe\nrial Palace is also unusual in that the imperial treasury,\narsenal, and cavalry were not located inside the palace\ncomplex.

Unlike\nthe shops of the Great Bazaar, these were arranged on a\nregular grid and aligned with the new city. Their impor\ntance to the regime was represented by the Qaisariya\nGateway on the new maidan; no other imperial bazaar\nin the Safavid realm had a monumental entrance.\nThe design of the individual buildings surrounding the\nnew maidan was not shockingly innovative, but their\norganization into a legible spatial composition was un\nprecedented in Iran. The \"Design of the World\" Maidan\nwas the heart of the new conception. The Imperial Pal\nace occupied the entire west side of the double-storey,\narcaded new maidan, having one monumental gateway\n(the Ali Qapu or \"Sublime Portal\") and two unobtrusive\nminor gates there. One grand portal opened onto each\nof the remaining sides of the maidan, giving access to\nthe Shah Mosque (south), the Mosque of Sheikh Lut\nfallah (east), and the Qaisariya Bazaar (north).\nWith one prodigious gateway on each of its sides, the\nnew maidan looked as if it were the courtyard of a\nfour-iwan mosque. Hence, the \"Design of the World\"\nwas a sacralized one which nevertheless included two\nhundred shops occupying the arcaded perimeter of the\nmaidan. Many other services were located inconspicu\nously just behind the maidan, including madrasas, fac\ntories, caravanserais, merchants' mansions, and\nAn old drawing of the new square\n\nwas the\nin Abbas's new\nShiite,\nAbbas made\nresided in\nthat its design\ntypes.\ndomed space,\nnot\na tomb.

It might very naturally be imagined that Shah Ab-\nbas would have made his avenue lead directly to the\nmaidan. Infact it came to an end on a point west of the\npalace grounds, where a pavilion was erected for the\nroyal seraglio to survey the scene. It was, indeed, as\nmuch a promenade as an avenue in this upper section;\nin the other direction, after crossing the river it became\na thoroughfare leading to the royal gardens of Hezarja\nrib and to Julfa.\nThe public boulevard consisted of four quadpartite gar\ndens arranged along a north-south axis that slopes to\nwards the south. Each quadpartite unit is composed of\ntwo square and two rectangular plots separated by path\nways and is located slightly lower than the preceding\nunit.

Before long, Armenians living outside Iran as\nwell as Christian missionaries, traders, and industrial\nists flooded the recent addition to Isfahan, making Julfa\na showcase for Safavid achievements in economic,\nsocial, and religious spheres as well as an example of\ntolerance and understanding among diverse ethnic and\nreligious groups in the region.\nShah Abbas's plan was motivated by several factors.\nFirst, the Armenians are a hardy people usually engaged\nin agriculture and industry. Secondly, Iran of his time\nwas a major producer of raw silk. By introducing bet\nter carpets and a new Iranian textile to the international\nmarket, the Armenian weavers could not only compete\nwith, but outdo the Ottomans and the Mughuls in the\never-growing silk trade. Thirdly, Shah Abbas intended\nto move Iran out of the middle Ages and into the 17th\ncentury. In this, the cooperation of the western powers\nof the time was a must. Christian Armenians, an en\nterprising people, could easily blend with the Christian\nWest, especially with those involved in the Indian silk\ntrade, and establish a foothold for the rest of the coun\ntry. Finally, Shah Abbas was seeking a way by which he\ncould decrease the fanaticism that permeated Safavid\nsociety. The city of Julfa across the Zayandeh-Rud with\nshops carrying Armenian names written out in both\nPersian and Armenian could not but inspire tolerance,\nespecially when the goods they carried added zest to\nthe Isfahanis otherwise austere Muslim existence.\nShah Abbas was fully aware of the international dy\nnamics that had facilitated the entrance of the Arme\nnians to the silk trade. In order to register this under\nstanding as well as underscore his nation's support of\nforeign trade, he ordered the construction of a major\nArmenian church in Julfa. The church was to be built\nby Iranian architects with the supervision of Armenian\nmanagers. The exterior of the church was to comply\nwith Muslim architectural decor while the interior sat\nisfied the requirements of Christian worship.\nAltogether, during the reign of the Safavid monarchs,\nespecially Shah Abbas, fourteen churches were built in\nJulfa. The oldest church was called the Church of Holy\nJacob or Hakup the building of which was completed\nin 1607.\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThe most memorable church in Julfa, the one that\ncomes to mind upon mentioning the name of the city, is\nthe Amenaperkich or the Church of the Savior.

Shah Abbas II took an active role in government\nmatters. Under his rule Iran revived, and some of Per-\nsia's glory in the eyes of the outside world returned.\nAfter Abbas II died in 1667, decline set in again when\nShah Soleyman (Safi II), who ruled from 1667 to 1694,\ntook power. He was renamed, superstitiously, to Soley\nman because the first year and half of his reign was so\ndisastrous. Shah Soleyman was not a competent ruler,\nand shortly after his accession food prices soared and\nfamine and disease spread throughout the country. Al\nthough pressing problems faced him, he increasingly\nretreated into the harem and left his grand vezir to cope\nwith affairs of state.\nShah Sultan Hossein, who ruled from 1694 to 1722,\nhave been described as the most incompetent shah of\nSafavids. He was similar to some others who had inher\nited power by accident of birth. Indifferent to affairs of\nstate, Shah Sultan Hossein effectively brought Safavid\nEmpire to its sudden and unexpected end. He was of\na religious temperament and especially influenced by\nthe Shi'a religious establishment. At their insistence, he\nissued decrees forbidding the consumption of alcohol\nand banning Sufism in Isfahan.\nSafavid Empire had also declined militarily, leaving\nit more vulnerable to invasion, which came out of the\neast.

The Egyptians were oppressed by the\nPersians and therefore welcomed Alexander as an\nally. Alexander the Great, was the King of the\nMacedons (Greeks). He had conquered most of\nAsia up to India when he invaded Egypt. When\nAlexander was coronated, he did so in the same\nfashion as the ancient Pharaohs, taking the title\n\"Son of Amun\". The Egyptians viewed Alexan\nder with a sense of divinity. He was considered\nthe founder of the new Pharnaonic dynasty. Alex\nandria was intended to supersede Naucratis as a\nGreek centre in Egypt, and to be the link between\nGreece and the rich Nile Valley.\nEgypt.\nAlexandria's siting made it a favorable choice for Alexander.\nHead bust of Alexander the Great\nThe Mediterranean during Antiquity\nNile during Alexandria's Reign.

The original site of the city housed a small\nvillage named Rhakotis. Alexandria is located\non a unique stretch of coast sandwiched between\nLake Mariut and the sea.\nThere were many reasons that Alexander picked\nthe site of Alexandria to be his capitol. Firstly,\nhe was attracted to the fact that the Island of the\nPharos already existed, which he had read about in\nHomer's Odyssey. Furthermore, he liked how the\nsite faced towards the north - to the Greek world\n- making it ideal for trading. Alexandria was far\nenough from the delta that it would not flood, yet\nclose enough for trading. Other advantages of the\nsite included its fresh water supply from the Nile\nthrough the Canopian branch, the presence of a\nsmall island which could be used for defense, and\nLake Mariut to the south, further strengthening\nthe defense.\nAlexander recognized these facts and foresaw\nthat Alexandria was geographically fit to be the\ncenter of the world's activity, thought, and com\nmercialism while having close contact to Eastern\nWealth. Alexander was stricken with a fever at\nthe age of 33 and died in 333 BC, but Alexandria\nstill became the capital of Egypt in 330 BC and\nThe Triumph of Alexander\nremained so until the Arabic Conquest.\nTapestry of the 18th centure depicting the triumphant entrance of Alexander into Babylon\n\nPTOLEMAIC DYNASTY (323 - 30 BC)\nALEXANDRIA\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nWhen Alexander died in 333 BC, his Empire\nwas split into three kingdoms: Ptolemy I (Rule\nof Egypt), Antigonids (Macedonia and Greece)\nand Seleucids (Western Asian and Iran). Ptolemy\ntook the position of satrap, or governor, in the\nsummer of 325 BC. He did not actually assume\nthe position of king until 305 BC. It would be the\nPtolemaic dynasty which ruled over Alexandria\nfor the next 300 years.\nFollowing in Alexander's tradition, Ptolemy\nbecame a patron to learning. It was Ptolemy's\nfriend, Demetrius, that inspired him to start the\ninfamous Alexandrian Library. A Museion, or\ninstitute for research in science accompanied the\nlibrary. The library and Museo attracted scholars\nfrom all parts of the Hellenistic World, creating a\ngreat diversity within Alexandria. The Ptolemaic\ndynasty spent more money on institutions than\nany other ancient dynasty.\nAfter Ptolemy I's death in 283 BC, Ptolemy II\nassumes his father's role and peacefully runs the\nkingdom. It is interesting to note that the Ptol\nemaic kings adopted the customs of the Pharaohs,\nincluding marriage between royal brothers and\nsisters. Ptolemy II took his sister, Arsinoe II, as\nhis second wife. His chief concern, however, was\nrooted in the internal administration of his king\ndom, and the patronage of literature and science.\nThe material and literary brilliance of the Alexan\ndrian court was at his height during Ptolemy II's\nreign (285 - 246 BC). This tradition continued\ninto Ptolemy III reign from 246-221 BC. During\nhis time the library grew rapidly. This was due to\na law that ensured that any foreign book entering\nthe country was taken by the library, and owners\nwere given a copy of their original book.\nThe decline of the empire began with Ptolemy IV\nand ran until Ptolemy X (XII). In fact Ptolemy\nX was given joint rule of the empire with his sis\nter/ wife, Cleopatra Bernice. He murdered her 19\ndays after their wedding, which enraged many Al\nexandrians. These Alexandrians inevitably killed\nTetradrachma of Ptolemy III\nCleopatra VII. 2nd century BCE\nPtolemy X in 80 BC.

It is often rumored the Julius Ceasar\nand Cleopatra were involved in intimate relations,\nand this is why she was given rule of Alexandria.\nCleopatra eventually takes control of Alexandria,\nand is crowned Queen.\nA Roman General by the name of Marchus An\nthony began an affair with Cleopatra, which dis\npleased many Romans. Octovian, Julius Caesar's\ngrand nephew, wad enraged by this and declared\nwar on Alexandria and Cleopatra. Cleopatra is\neventually defeated in 31 BC and commits suicide\non the doorsteps of the Cecil Hotel.

Ptolemy is granted Alexander's Empire in Egypt.\n\nORIGINS OF CITY PLANNING\nALEXANDRIA\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDespite the fact that the city was made after the\ndeath of Alexander, it was designed to be in accor\ndance with his vision. This was due in a large part\nto Cleomenes of Naucratis, Alexander's collector\nof revenues. After his death, in accordance with\nhis wish, Cleomenes of Naucratis continually of\nfered financial support to the city's creation. The\ncity planning was carried out by Dinocrates of\nRhodes, a Greek architect chosen by Ptolemy I.\nDinocrates had a comprehensive plan for the city\nthat was carried out in the following order; city\nwalls, street grids, the harbor, and a high effiency\nwater supply. From the onset, the planning of Al\nexandria was intended to by of grand dimension\nwhen compared to other Greek Cities. Dinocrates\nalso designed a bridge to connect the mainland to\nthe Island of the Pharos. The bridge, 1300m in\nDiagrammatic Plan of Ancient Alexandria\nlength was called the Hepastadium. The bridge\neffectively created two ports in the city; the Eas\nter Port (Portus Magnum) and the Western Port\n(Portus Eunostos).\nThese streets still persist in modern day Alexan\ndria (Horreya Street and Nabi Daniel). The two\ngreat streets were said to be between 25m and\n60m (this point is heavily debated amongst ar-\nAfter the street grid was laid down and the walls\nwere built, the city was split into five districts offi\ncially named after the first five letters of the Greek\nalphabet. The primary districts were:\ncheologists). They were paved with squares of\ngranite and lined with marble colonnades. The\nCanopic Way ran East-West and terminated at the\nCanopic Gate and Necropolis Gate - located at the\ncity walls. Street of Soma ran North-South, and\n1. Jewish Quarter - Known as the 'delta' quarter.\nconnected the Moon Gate and Sungate.\n2. Rhacotis - Occupied primarily by the Egyp\ntians. This district retained the name of the origi\nnal fishing village.\n3. Brucheum - The royal, or Greek quarter. It was\nknown as the 'majestic' part of the city. This dis\ntrict occupied approximately a third of the city's\narea and contained most of the grand public insti\ntutions. It was in this district that one would find\nThe largest landuse program in ancient Alex\nandria was residential.

This main street is estimated to have been between 25-60 m in width. Some\nestimates place it as large as 70m.\nAlexandria was organized around a gridiron plan,\nkeeping with the Hellenstic tradition. They city\nwas subdivided into four quadrants by two great\navenues - The Canopic Way and Street of Soma.\nThree walls were built in the history of Alexan\ndria:\n1. The Hellenistic Wall - the original wall\n2. The Roman Wall - and extension of the original\n\nThe only remaining section of the Hellenistic wall.\nThese are found in the Shallat Gardens.\nwall towards the east.\n3. Supplemented medieval wall in the 9th century\nby the Sultan Ahmed Ibn Tulun. It is curious to\nnote that the third city wall contracted in size as\nthey neither had the population or army to defend\nthe large city size. This is part of the reason why\nlittle of the ancient city still remains.\nToday, only a small part of the Hellenistic wall\nremains, which can be found in the Shallat Gar\ndens.\nSTREETS and BLOCKS\nThe street grid of Alexandria was derived from\nthe Hippodamian System. According to ancient\nwriters the grid was always part of the original\nplan. The layout of the streets was towards the\nCardinal Axes (or what was believed to be the\nCardinal Axes, as the street layout appears to be\nrotated about 25 degrees from the Cardinal Axes\nto contemporary archeologists). It is believed\nthat the layout of the grid in line with the Cardinal\nAxes was to ensure that the city was exposed to\nthe prevailing winds to the north, thereby keeping\nthe city cool in the summer.\nAlexandria was built on a level of infrastructure used\nfor Cisterns.\nKeeping in line with the majestic quality of the\ncity, the streets were exceptionally wide. The\nmain streets were 20-60 m in width and secondary\nstreets were 12 m in width. This made the street\nideal for horseback riding, chariot driving as well\nas a place for socializing. The two main streets,\nthe Canopic way and Street of Soma were lined\nwith colonnades.\nArcheologist Mahumed El Falaki deduced that\nthe block dimension was 167m, about 10 m less\nthan the 'stade' used in other Greek cities. It is\nstill unsure how the block was subdivided but in\nmost speculative theories the block was perimeter\nlined with a courtyard types.\nWATER\nAlexandria is often referred to as the city of cis\nterns. The entire city is fundamentally built over\na level of cisterns, similar to Constantinople.\nThis level of infrastructure running under the city\nbrought housed water supplies from the delta as\nwell as the Mahmudiyya Canal. Many of these\ncisterns have been recently discovered and can be\nvisited.\nALEXANDRIA\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nArtist depiction of Ancient city, including the city\nwalls\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe following measurements give an idea of the\ngrand scale of Alexandria.\nCity Walls: 15.8 km\nLength of the City: 5.09 km.\nWidth of the City: 1.15 km (Western Edge), 1.4\nkm (Eastern edge)\nWidest part of the City: 1.7 km (Center)\n18 Main streets, 7 EW and 11 NS\nANCIENT LIBRARY 280 - 288 BC\n\"A Sanitorium for the Mind\"\n- Inscription on the entry way\nThe library of Ancient Alexandria is perhaps the\nmost notable building type from the Ptolemy Pe\nriod.

Accordingly, the library was pub-\nORIGINS OF CITY PLANNING\nHepastade and Island of the Pharos\nlic establishment belonging to the state. Its ex\npenses were paid for the by the state. This was a\nnew concept during Hellenic times, as scientific\ninstitutes and libraries had always been private.\nSome of these private institutions include the\n\"Academy\" founded by Plato, and \"Lochiam\"\nfounded by Aristotle.\nThe library contained about 128,000 volumes dur\ning Cleopatra VII's time. It also had an interna\ntional dimension, housing literature from Greece,\nRome, India and Egypt. What is not readily\nknown is that there were in fact two libraries in\nAncient Alexandria. There was a large one in the\nBrucheum Quarter attached to the museum and a\nsmaller one in the Serapeum, a famous temple.\nThe smaller library was created as an extension to\nthe primary library.\nIt is still not completely known how and when the\nlibrary was destroyed, but it is assumed to have\nstarted in 48 BC when Julius Caesar set fire to\nfleet in the harbor, destroying a large number of\nthe books. The library is believed to have been\ncompletely destroyed in 272 AD during the battle\nbetween Firmus and the Romans.\n\nROMAN/ BYZANTINE PERIOD (30 BC - 642 AD)\nAfter defeating Cleopatra, Octovanian takes hold\nof Egypt and holds it as a piece of personal prop\nerty. Octovanian was renamed as Augustus when\nhe takes on the role of king. The Romans often\ndestroyed the cities they took hold of, but Augus\ntus did not do so with Alexandria. He pardoned it\nfor sake of Alexander, in admiration of its beauty\nand grandeur, and in appreciation of his teacher\nand friend, Aruis. During the reign of Trajen and\nHadrian, the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) exist\ned, increasing commerce and industry along the\nMediterranean and once again making Alexandria\na fairly prosperous city.\nDespite the increased commerce, Alexandria was\nnot as prosperous as during the Ptolemic Dynasty.\nThe Romans controlled Alexandria remotely, and\nwere more interested in the wealth of Egypt than\nthe standard of living in Alexandria. They raised\nthe taxes and imposed a lower standard of living.\nMany contemporary historians believe that the\nRomans were in fact fearful of Alexandria as a\ndominant city, and thus paid little attention to it to\ninstigate its demise. It has been discovered that\nmany of the books from Alexandria were taken\nto Rome in the second century AD. During this\nperiod the literacy rate in Alexandria was low, and\nChristianity increased in popularity.\nDuring the Roman Rule it was a unique time to be\nan Alexandrian. On one hand, they were the in\ntellectual center of the ancient world, and in other\nrespects they were slowly declining as a powerful\ncity. When the Pax Romana ended in 180 AD, Al\nexandria lost a large amount of commerce and the\npopulation declined. In 215 AD, the Roman Em\nperor Caracalla visited Alexandria. Alexandrians\nwere always known for free speech. They had\nmade reference to Caracalla as a cruel murderer\nof his own brother in their satires. Upon his visit,\nCaracalla ordered all the youth of the city dead.\nIn 272 AD, Firmus, a wealthy merchant from Ethi\nopia, seizes government of Egypt. This causes the\nRoman Emperor, Aurelian, to call a war against\nFirmus. During the battle, the library and museum\nALEXANDRIA\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepiction of the Interior of the Ancient Library\nIllustration of the building of the Pharos Lighthouse\nIllustration of the Interior of the Library\nare believed to have perished. The Romans defeat\nFirmus, but the notion of Alexandria as the center\nof knowledge and learning fades. In 296 AD the\nEmperor Diocletian subjects Alexandria to a siege\nfor 9 months. Despite this, philosophy begins to\nflourish in the city, and Christianity continues to\nspread. Alexandria becomes the intellectual cen\nter of the Christian world. Egypt is ruled by the\nByzantine Empire in 395 AD, controlled by Con\nstantinople.\nIn 400 AD debates on the role of\nthe church and science emerge causing many resi\ndents move to Athens or Constantinople. In 616\nAD, Khosran II, The King of Persia seizes control\nof Alexandria. Ten years later, in 626 AD, Rome\ntakes Alexandria back into their possession. The\nRoman Empire finally loses control of Alexandria\nin 642 AD to the Arab general Amr Ibn Al-As\nDuring the (remote) Roman rule of Alexandria,\nvery few changes are made to the city. Besides\nextending the city walls a few blocks to the East\nand a few unplanned settlements outside the city\nwalls, the Romans made no formal changes to\nAlexandria. Alexandria was one of the grandest\ncities in the Ancient world before the Roman rule.\nRome continuously felt threatened by Alexandria,\nand added few elements to the city during their\n600 year presence.\nThe Death of Cleopatra\nPortrait of Octavian.

In 645\nAD, during the second Arab conquest, portions of\nthe wall and towers were destroyed. This fact,\ncombined with the drying of the Nile at the Gulf\nof Alexandria (due to increase in sand and mud\nresidues) caused the population to decrease sig\nnificantly. Up until this point Alexandria was still\na fairly cosmopolitan city in the ancient world,\nmade up of Egyptians, Greeks, Romans and Jew\nish citizens. The second conquest in 645 caused\nAlexandria to 'Arabize' and lose it foreign char\nacteristics. Before this conquest, many Romans\nhad lived in the city, but they were forced out after\nthe second conquest, as they could not be trusted.\nThis 'Arabizing' of the city, weakened the city's\neconomy significantly.\nIn 868 AD, Ibn Tulun declares Egypt as indepen\ndent of the Arab Empire. Tulun was the founder of\nthe Tulunid dynasty which ruled Egypt for about\nhalf a century, and was the first Muslim gover\nnor of Egypt to annex Syria. During his reign,\nhe builds new walls, fortifies the coast, and reno\nvated the lighthouse (797 AD).

The Fatimids were an\nIsmaili Shiite dynasty that ruled much of North\nAfrica from 910 AD to 1171 AD. During the\nFatimid period, Egypt occupied a central position\nin the Arab world. Unlike other governments in\nthe area, Fatimid advancement in state offices was\nbased more on merit than on heredity. Members\nof other branches of Islam, were just as likely to\nbe appointed to government posts as Shiites. This\ntolerance extended to non-Muslims - Christians\nand Jews - who occupied high levels in govern\nment based solely on ability. This tolerance of\ndifferent religions allowed the Fatimid state to\nmerge seemlessly into Egyptian life. This helped\nboth the artistry and economy of Alexandria. Dur\ning this time, Alexandria hosted a large number of\nscientists and poets from Morocco, reminiscent of\nthe Ptolemic Alexandria. The Fatimid state ended\nin 1171 when El Hussein was martyred. Up until\nthis point, little had changed with the original grid\niron plan of Alexandria. Each empire inhabited\nthe ancient Greek city, and made little to no al\n16th century map of Alexandria\nterations to its form, layout or fabric.\nThe Ayyubid state (1171-1250 AD) followed the\nFatimid Period. This was an Islamic Jihad State,\ncomprised of Kurds from Atherbejan. During\nthis period, ruler Salah El Din fortified the walls\n(1181), and made Alexandria into a naval base. He\nalso ordered the Roman columns be thrown into\nthe harbor to prevent enemy ships from reaching\nthe city. Salah El Din improved the standard of\nliving in Alexandria, primarily through convinc\ning the wealthy to invest in the city. During the\nAyyubid Era, Alexandria formed new 'suburban'\ndistricts to the west and south of the city. These\nwere built according to the design of Islamic cit\nies, with narrow alleys and markets.\nFrom 1250 - 1517, Egypt was ruled by the Mam\nluks, a military elite. It is during this time that\nAlexandria becomes the most important commer\ncial center/ port in the Islamic World. This was in\na large part due to the Mediterranean spice trade,\nof which Alexandria was at the center of. Alexan\ndria received great amounts of pepper, cinnamon,\nnutmeg, and mace from India and beyond, which\nwere sold to the European traders at enormously\ninflated prices. It was also during the Mamluk re-\nMap of Alexandria, 1699\ngime that a large earthquake destroyed the Pharos\nlighthouse. Mamluk Sultan Qaybey built a fort in\nits place, which still remains today.\nIn 1365, a governote is installed in Alexandria.\nTrade continues to flourish until 1498, when the\ndiscovery of a route to the East occurrs. This new\nconnection was found between the Portuguese\nand Indian Ocean and creates a large economic\ndepression in Alexandria. The Portuguese had a\ncheaper commercial market that Alexandria could\nnot compete with. As economic and population\ndecline took charge, epidemic began to spread.\nFurthermore, this corresponded to the blocking of\nthe canal, which further reduced trade in Alexan\ndria.\nIn 1517 the Turks conquer Egypt, and it became\npart of the Ottoman Empire. During this time,\nAlexandria was a small, deprived village. Most\npeople during this time lived by the sea gate, as\nthere was not much within the walls. The Turk\nish conquerors did not change anything of the old\nplan, as they settled in the abandon houses. Dur\ning the Arab and Turkish rule, they introduced the\nbuilding type of the Mosque.

They moved the capital for several\nreasons; when the Nile flooded, it separated the\nArab countries from Alexandria and secondly,\nAlexandria was constantly subject to raids from\nthe sea (from the Byzantine fleet). The moving\nof the capital caused further economic depression\nand slowed down trade in Alexandria. As taxes\nincreased, the population further declined. Alex\nandria was a mere village at this point.\nMap of Alexandria, 1553 during the Ottoman Empire\n\nALEXANDRIA\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nMahammed Ali passed away in 1848. During\nhis time in power, the population of Alexandria\nincreased from 4,000 to 143,000. Mohmed Said\ncontinued his vision for economic revival, and set\nup a railway connection between Alexandria and\nCairo in 1856.\nIn 1873, the French sculptor, Jacquemont was\ncommissioned to plan the streets.

A\nsignificant era marked by decisive unification of the Pars\ntribes during the reign of Astyages and his grandson,\nCyrus, who initially formed an extensive, centralized\nand mighty empire. Ironically, Achaemenian's most re\nmarkable military expedition against the Greeks took\nplace in 480 B.C. resulting in both the Iranian's defeat\nand Seizure of undisputed power by Alexander. During\nAchaemenian's period, a lot of political and financial\ndecisions were made to make the empire work better.\nCyrus and Darius the great were geniuses in leading the\ncountry towards prosperity. Economy was glorious and\nseveral roads were made to make the trade easier.\nFor example \"Silk Road\" was one of the ancient trade\nroutes which led to Kashgar from two opposite direc\ntions of north and south. Extending westward to Sa\nmarkand, Marv and Balkh in northern region of Iran,\npassing through Central Asia leading to ancient Greece.\nThis major historical route connecting the west to the\n\"the Silk Road\", as previously mentioned. This road\nis specially important for our study about the city of\nIsfahan which was one of the cities near this route.\nThe pre-Islam civilization of Iran takes pride in such\ninnovations, particularly because the management and\nmaintenance of the \"King's Great Road\" 25 Centuries\nago constituted great honor for Iranians among all na\ntions.\nThe \"Throne of Jamshid\" or Persepolis was chosen as\nIran's capital during the rule of Achaemenians. How\never, the corner-stone of Persepolis was laid during the\nreign of Darius I - after whom each king added more\nsections to the site. Also the cities of Susa, Babylonia\nand Ekbatan each in turn served as the nation's capi\ntal.\nAfter Achaemenid dynasty which was vanished by Al\nexander, and after the death of Alexander in Iran, one\nof his commanders, Slokus, made a new dynasty in 312\nB.C. which ruled Iran for about sixty five years.\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n.

During the rule of\nArdeshir, the founder of the Sassanide dynasty, a very\npowerful centralized government developed and for\nthe first time in Iran the religion of Zoroaster (the\nIranian prophet) was declared as the official religion.\nA faith whose essential pillars are laid upon virtuous\nthoughts, virtuous words, and virtuous deeds.\nThe Prophet of Islam, Mohammad (was born in the\ncity of Mecca during the rule of Anushirvan Sassani,\nand was chosen as the completion of all prophecy and\nthe last prophet during the reign of Khosrow Parviz\nThe map of Persian Empire\neast was known as the Great Road of Khorasan or\n(610 A.D.). Weakness of the Sassanide government,\noppressions of the Kings, and at the same time Islam's\nrising power were the imperative factors which led to\nthe victory of Islam's army over the Iranian military in\nthe course of numerous battles. The Prophet Moham\nmad migrated to Medina from Mecca (622 A.D).\nThus, this particular year was chosen as the base of\nthe Muslims' calendar owing to the indisputable effect\nof this migration. At that time, Islam spread mainly\nin the Arabian Peninsula, and after the prophet in the\nSouthern parts of Iran, Syria, Iraq, Turkey and all\nof Egypt as well as northern part of Syria embraced\nIslam.\nIslamic Iran\nThe first century of Islamic Iran was spent on fights\nand switching power from Umayyed Arabs to Abassid\nArabs. When the atmosphere got calmer and all op\nposing groups lost their wars, several different parallel\ndynasties were ruling Iran. These governments, each\nwere established in different parts of the large empire\nand were mostly of Iranian origin with Islamic and\nArab supporters.\nThe expedition of the devastating mogul tribe to Iran\nbegan 1256 B.C. and the last Persian King of the\ndynasty, Sultan Jalal-e-din Kharazmshah was over\nthrown by Gengiz's army and later put to death. The\nperiod of Mogul chieftain's rule in Iran was the most\noppressed era the nation had ever seen and the condi\ntions did not change until the founding of the Iranian\ndynasty, the Safavids, and the rule of Shah Ismeal.\nThe Moguls were removed from Iran's political\nscene after about 300 years by the Safavids, and Shah\nIsmeal was crowned in Tabriz. During the reign of\nSafavid dynasty relations between Iran and European\nand other countries expanded and Iran's powerful\ncentralized government, during Shah Abbas's rule,\nestablished political and economic ties with great\nleaders such as Queen Elizabeth, Philip II the king of\nSpain, India's Akbar shah and also put an end to the\ndomination of Portuguese in the Persian Gulf. The\nIranian culture and art once again flourished during\nthe Safavid rule and architecture, carpet-weaving,\nminiature painting, gilding and handicrafts found\nspecial development.\n\nAfter the Safavids, alternately weak and strong govern\nments came to power among which the government of\nNader Shah Afshar, Karim Khan Zand, Agha Moham\nmad Khan Qajar, Naser-e-din Shah and Mozafar-e-din\nShah are noteworthy. During the rule of Nader Shah,\nThe Russians were expelled from Iran, the booties\nwhich the Ottomans had taken from the country were\nrecovered, Kandhar and Delhi became parts of Iran and\nonce again the Iranian territory was expanded and in\ncluded a vast area of Southeast Asia. Oppression and\ntyranny became prevalent in the course of the Qajar\ndynasty's rule due to treason of courtiers and the Kings'\npowerlessness and inattention to the state of affairs.\nThe unprecedented and historical measures of Mirza\nTaghi Khan Amir Kabir, Naser-e-din Shah's prime\nminister, such as dispatching students abroad for higher\neducation, printing of newspaper, compilation of laws,\netc. made him an immortal historical personage.\nThe new era began with the reign of the Pahlavi dy\nnasty. Reza Shah, commander of a Kazak battalion,\noccupied Tehran on 22 Feb. 1920, and five years later\ncrowned himself the King with the support of England.\nIn 1941 under pressure by England, he abdicated the\nthrone in favor of his son Mohammad-Reza and was\nexiled to Johannesburg in South Africa where he later\ndied. Mohammad-Reza ruled for another 40 years and\nwas put down by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Is\nlamic government is ruling Iran since today.\nISFAHAN\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nIran's Brief History\nPersepolis- The ancient palace of pre-Islamic Iran\nThe map of the silk road"

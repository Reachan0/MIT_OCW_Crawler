  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: One session / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Philosophy\n\nThis research seminar provides a setting in which to build upon computing and analytic skills developed in previous subjects and to explore strategic planning and policy issues regarding the impacts on urban planning of emerging information and communication technologies (ICT). The seminar is closely tied to current Urban Information Systems (UIS) research in the MIT Urban Studies and Planning Department. Much of this research involves geographic information systems (GIS), multimedia technologies and the design and prototyping of urban planning tools and metropolitan information infrastructure. Ongoing work also involves institutional analysis and new theories about planning strategies, the economics of place, and land use and transportation interactions. 11.522 is intended to enable advanced Master's and PhD students to work on special projects of interest to them which can be related to ongoing UIS work in order to tap into a critical mass of information, technology, planning context, and peer review.\n\nCourse Description and Content\n\nSeminar participants and invited guests will lead critical discussions of current literature and ongoing research. Each student will be responsible for identifying, reviewing, and presenting one structured discussion of articles from the current literature that are relevant to their research topic. The remaining time will be spent working on individual projects or thesis proposals. This fall, the seminar will focus on the following core issues that underlie most implementations of urban information systems and decision support tools:\n\nThe sustainable acquisition and representation of urban knowledge\n\nThe emergent technological infrastructure for supporting metropolitan decision-making\n\nThe innovative organizational and institutional arrangements that can take advantage of modern urban information systems\n\nDuring the semester, there will be occasional UIS seminar talks by outside speakers. These talks will provide insight and in-depth discussion about the knowledge representation, technology, and institutional dimensions of some of the topics covered in the weekly DUSP program group seminars. Generally, these seminars will take place over Friday lunch, and we'll try to hold them during the same week as the corresponding program group talk. These in-depth UIS seminars will be considered part of 11.522, and students taking 11.522 will be expected to attend these occasional Friday lunch seminars.\n\nFormat\n\nEach week, there will be one session lasting up to two hours (during the scheduled Tuesday afternoon time) for discussion of research areas, class projects, and selected articles. Additional lab hours will be arranged as needed to facilitate access to equipment and data that students may need for their projects. Each student will be responsible for (a) leading at least one class discussion of published papers in the current literature concerning a selected topic of interest, (b) undertaking an individual or group project involving a written and oral presentation, and (c) participating in seminar discussions and out-of-class email exchanges. A schedule of topics and presenters is given in the\ncalendar\nsection. Individual class projects typically lead to a thesis proposal, empirical study, comparative analysis, computer-based modeling exercise, and/or the demonstration of a software prototype.\n\nPrerequisites and Sequencing\n\nWhile most projects are likely to involve hands-on use of GIS and database management technologies, this is not a requirement. However, students\nare\nexpected to have some knowledge of metropolitan information infrastructures and digital representations of 'place' and spatial relationships prior to taking 11.522 (see the list of prerequisites below). Typically, this involves GIS and database management skills. Students should have sufficient computing proficiency and an understanding of information and communication technology use in urban planning - as evidenced by\n11.204\n(Planning, Communication, and Digital Media) and at least one of\n11.520\n(A Workshop on Geographic Information Systems),\nor\n\n11.521\n(Spatial Database Management), or equivalent. MCP students normally take this course during their second year with the intention of linking the course to thesis preparation, an internship, and the like. PhD students often take the subject more than once as they work on their first-year paper, general exam preparation, research assistantships, and dissertation.",

      "content": "11.522: PSS Research Seminar (Fall 2005) - Discussion notes\nSession 2\nCity Knowledge: an Emergent Information Infrastructure for\nSustainable Urban Maintenance, Management and Planning.\nDiscussants: Fabio Carrera & Joe Ferreira\nIntroduction:\nRecent advances in geo-spatial technologies, together with a steady decline in their cost,\nhave inspired many spontaneous bottom-up municipal initiatives aimed at improving the\nflow and availability of information for the purpose of maintaining, managing, and\nplanning urban spaces. Simultaneously, spatial data sets are more readily available and\nsome cities have institutionalized top-down systems that allow planners and other\nprofessionals to make maps and perform basic analytical functions. In his dissertation,\nFabio Carrera argues the need for a middle-out approach whereby we combine the virtues\nbottom-up specificity with top-down efficiency. The dissertation is based on Fabio's\nexperience in designing, maintaining, and using municipal-level geographic information\nsystems, especially in his hometown of Venice, Italy, to propose and promote the concept\nof City Knowledge. City Knowledge is a paradigm that aims at instilling in front-line\nmunicipal departments an information aware modus operandi that will emancipate town\nplanners, managers and decision-makers from \"hunter-gatherers\" of plan-demanded data\nto \"farmers\" of plan-ready information so that city knowledge can be regarded as an\ninfrastructure because it provides an essential and ongoing service to ordinary citizens,\njust like a city's transit system or its water and sewer network.\nQuestions:\nIn light of the materials you will be reading in preparation for this class (listed below), we\nsuggest that you consider the following questions in the context of your own class\nproject:\n(a) How could the datasets that you foresee using in your project be made to become\n\"plan-ready\"? Which would be the \"low-hanging fruit\"? Are there specific\nstandard data representations and geometries that could be used? Who should be\nin charge (jurisdictionally) of the \"birth certificates\" (and updates) associated with\nthe datasets that you are using?\n(b) What technological infrastructure would be best suited to support a full-fledged\nCity Knowledge system? What 'middleware' applications may be required to\nmake existing (and periodically updated) datasets re-usable in different\ncircumstances by a variety of municipal departments? What could be the role of\n\nmobile technologies to be able to \"pull\" location-specific urban information in the\ncourse of day-to-day maintenance or inspectional activities?\n(c) How could an information infrastructure be \"grown\" through a skillful\napplication of a combination of the 5 tools? How could this \"data farming\" be\nmade as inexpensive and systematic as possible? What could be some strategies\nto \"catch up with the backlog\" of information already \"out there\" in the world\n(and in paper archives)? And what strategies and mechanisms could be put in\nplace to \"intercept future change\" so that these datasets could be maintained up-\nto-date in perpetuity?\n(d) How could a \"middle-out\" approach be adopted in the institutions that are\nconnected to your project to foster the \"emergence\" of City Knowledge? Are the\ndata-producing organizations and the end-user organizations predominantly top-\ndown or bottom-up? Do the institutions related to your project exhibit obvious\nsigns of inefficiency and redundancy in the collection and use of urban\ninformation that would justify an investment in an integrated comprehensive\nmunicipal information system based on City Knowledge principles?\nArticles and Other Readings:\nIn preparation for this discussion, we suggest that you read or skim the following:\n(1) For a full explanation of the concept of City Knowledge, you should skim Fabio\nCarrera's PhD dissertation especially Part I and Part V and you should ready more\ncarefully Part IV.\n(2) When it comes to implementing government policies, a school of thought that has\nbeen put forward by DUSP faculty, suggests that we focus on the so-called \"Five\ntools of Government Action\". A full description of these tools can be found in the\nbook \"Preserving the Built Heritage\" edited by our own Mark Schuster and John\nDeMonchaux. There is a summary of the concepts in the introduction chapter. A\nshorter version is contained in Policy and Planning with Purpose.\n(3) The concept of \"Emergence\" features prominently in the City Knowledge\napproach. If you are interested, we suggest that you read the popular book\nEmergence by Steven Johnson. You may find the book very stimulating. At the very\nleast should familiarize yourself with the concept by googling \"emergence\" so you\ncan look at shorter explanations such as the Wikipedia entry for the term.\n(4) Prof. Ferreira describes middleware applications in his article entitled \"Information\nTechnologies that Change Relationships between Low-Income Communities and the\nPublic and Non-profit Agencies that Serve Them\" as well as in the MIT/MAPC\nproposal \"Intelligent Middleware for Understanding Neighborhood Markets\" a pilot\nproject of the Brookings Institution Urban Markets Initiative.\n\n(5) For recent accounts of the Planning Support Systems that are already in use around\nthe world, you can take a look at Klosterman's recent (2005) guest editorial in\nEnvironment and Planning B, as well as to Maguire and Longley's paper on \"The\nemergence of geoportals and their role in spatial data infrastructures.\" An older, but\ninteresting paper predating City Knowledge is Rubenstein-Montano's Survey of\nknowledge-based information systems for urban planning.\nRubenstein-Montano, B. \"A survey of knowledge-based information systems for urban planning: moving towards\nknowledge management.\" Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 24 (2000): 155-172."

      "content": "11.522: UIS Research Seminar (Fall 2005) - Discussion notes\nSession 3\nEmpowering Communities Through Better Data\nSharing\nDiscussants: Joe Ferreira & Fabio Carrera\nWe would like to discuss planning strategies and information infrastructure that might\nfacilitate 'community empowerment' and innovative community development strategies.\nSpatially detailed metropolitan data about land use, ownership, jobs, etc. is rapidly\nimproving and more and more agencies and NGOs have, or want, in-house capacity to do\ntheir own neighborhood analyses. In recent years, a number of projects and research\nefforts have tried to assist community groups and local agencies in acquiring relevant\nplanning data and improving their neighborhood planning and advocacy capacity. These\ntrends have led to many 'indicator' efforts and a proliferation of 'data centers' whereby\neach organization tries to acquire and maintain a copy of all relevant data. At the scale of\ncities or even census tracks, it is practical to archive decennial datasets. However, at the\nscale of parcels, persons, building permits, bus stops, and the like, having a copy of\neverything is not practical. We'd like to discuss the nature and content of 'city knowledge'\nrelevant to neighborhood planning and some of the strategies and institutional issues\ninvolved in empowering communities through better access to information.\nTo facilitate the discussion, I've identified 6 online readings. They are listed below. Item\n(1) is the website of a 'community of practice' of several hundred professionals at local,\nstate, and federal levels who are interested in facilitating an improved 'National\nInfrastructure for Community Statistics' (NICS). This site provides background\ninformation regrading many relevant issues and strategies. Items (2) through (4) involve\nefforts related to the Brooking Institution's Urban Markets Initiative (UMI) to improve\ncommunity development methods. Item (2) describes the UMI initiative. Item (3) is one\nof the UMI-funded projects that is organized by an Urban Institute-organized\ncollaboration among community organizations across a two dozen metropolitan areas.\nItem (4) is another UMI-funded project here at MIT that is prototyping particular\napproaches for codifying and using local knowledge. Item (5) is a chapter of Dr. Raj\nSingh's PhD dissertation on the use of web services architectures to support collaborative\nplanning. The Urban Institute proposal involves several community groups in several\ncities that are part of the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership (NNIP) that Tom\nKingsley and others at the Urban Institute have organized. They propose to build several\n'decision support tools' that can help 'grassroots' efforts. The MIT/MAPC proposal\nsuggests an architecture for improving the practicality of community information systems\nby making it easier to share 'official' data and to incorporate local knowledge when\ninterpreting city data. Raj's thesis suggests a 'web services' approach for the sharing of\nplanning data and models. Item (6) is the URL for the Google Earth 3D viewer and a\n\nwebsite discussing how Google Earth allows users to publish their own georeferenced\ndata that can be viewed using Google Earth.\nSkim through the NICS site to get a sense of the people, organizations, issues, and\nstrategies that have been discussed through the various NICS activities during the past\nfew years. Then read the UMI overview and the two project proposals. You may want to\nskim through the NNIP site to see what cities, organizations, and projects are involved.\nFinally, read at least the one chapter of Raj's thesis to understand the reasoning about\nwhy and how service-oriented information systems architecture would be qualitatively\ndifferent from traditional approaches toward land use planning and neighborhood\nanalysis.\nThe Google Earth links are to stimulate your thinking about appropriate user interfaces\nfor viewing community data and viable ways of decomposing the 'information at your\nfingertips' idea can be decomposed into manageable pieces of 'local knowledge', 'city\nknowledge', 'web-based viewing tools. If you don't have access to Google Earth and\nhaven't seen it before, then *don't* spend time on that - focus on the other readings\ninstead. It will be on CRN machines later this semester and we don't want the whole-\nearth data and nice 3D graphics to distract us from our discussion of city knowledge,\ncommunity empowerment, and data sharing.\nDiscussion questions;\n(a) What 'problems' are framed in the UMI overview? Who is supporting the UMI effort?\nWhat do they want, what do they assume, and what do they anticipate doing differently\nas a result?\n(b) What is the 'city knowledge' needed to support the kinds of decision support tools that\nare envisioned in the UMI proposals? In what way, if any, are the data, decision support\ntools and methods in the Urban Institute proposal different from those that a city agency\nmight have designed and built?\n(c) How does the MIT/MAPC 'middleware' approach differ from the traditional way of\nbuilding the types of decision support tools that UI proposes? What applications are most\npromising to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach?\n(d) What 'middleware' system architecture is practical today? What skill set is needed by\nwhom in order for it to deliver useful assistance to community groups? What partners\nmake sense? What role can/should a regional planning organization (such as MAPC)\nplay? What institutional and organizational obstacles might we anticipate?\nNotes about readings for the first two classes:\nFabio's presentation (Discussion Note 1):\n\n-\nBetter GIS data at parcel scale can have large urban management payoff\n-\nModern IT allows 'city knowledge' to be collected and maintained in new ways\nthat are affordable, sustainable, and very useful\nJoe's presentation:\n-\nNational Infrastructure for Community Statistics (NICS): frustration with\no data gathering difficulties\no complexity of indicator development (numerator A / denominator B ) for\nvarious times and geographies\no difficulties integrating of local knowledge\n-\nUrban Markets Initiative (UMI): getting right information to right actors at\nneighborhood level\n-\nIntelligent Middleware for Understanding Neighborhood Markets\no can' t empower communities just by broadcasting official city data\no 'spelling errors' never go away - official data always needs 'tweaking'\no codify and accumulate 'local knowledge' separate from official city data\no distributed data and knowledge requires complex infrastructure - worth the\neffort to distinguish basemaps, facades, rules, reports, thematic maps\n-\nUrban Institute - (NNIP) - Decision Support Tools To Guide Urban Land Markets\no NGOs are developing sustainable (but labor intensive) community\ninformation systems\no non-governmental partnerships can share knowledge effectively\n-\nSingh, Raj.

This session can be seen as a special\ncase of this framework in the redevelopment of US inner cities.\nThe economic distress of American's inner cities is one of the most pressing issues facing\nthe nation. There are substantial researches and development programs focusing on the\nrevitalization of economically dilapidated inner city neighborhoods. Though differing in\ntheir approaches, many analysts have described the unmet retail demand in inner city\nneighborhoods and the potential of translating this demand into investment. Tapping the\nunmet retail demand has been considered as one import strategy to accelerate the\neconomic development in inner cities. However, there is a 'gloomy vision' among market\nactors towards the inner cities: i n the Unite d States, the term 'inner city' is perhaps most\nwidely understood to mean the poorer parts at the center of a major city, which is riddled\nwith crime and uneducated labor and is a ghost town for business. When such 'gloomy\nvision' prevails, the market potential of inner cities as business locations either will be not\nperceived at all or will be largely undervalued. In these circumstances, the inner cities are\nexperiencing a shortage of investment and market activities.\nToday, a large and growing number of local agencies and community organization are\nactively engaged in efforts to quantify and evaluate the social economic, and cultural\nhealth of their neighborhoods, and provide more accurate 'knowledge' to policy makers\nand market actors . These effort involve the use of various public and private data,\naccelerated by the improvement in computing, GIS, RDBMS, information and\ncommunication technologies.\nThis session will concentrate on the role that information technology can play in the\nunderstanding of inner city markets and the redevelopment of inner city neighborhoods.\nPlease read the articles below and consider the following questions to discuss on Tuesday.\nDiscussion questions:\n1. What are the main differences among the strategies to revitalize inner city\nneighborhoods?\n\n2. Why is the 'gloomy vision' towards inner cities pervasive? Why are the\ncomparative advantages of inner cities not perceived at all or largely\nundervalued ? What is wrong in the \"information cycle\"?\n3. To draw a true picture of inner city markets, w hat kind s of neighborhood\nindicators may be useful ? What are the main obstacles in building up such\nneighborhood indicator systems?\n4. How can the overall structure, as well as specific tools, shown in the MIT/MAPC\nUMI project be used in the revitalization of inner city?\n5. What may be the main obstacles in the implementation of the MIT/MAPC UMI\napproach ? How can we solve these problems with technical and institutional\nrenovation?"

Since\nit caught people's attentions in 1950s, it has not really left the newspaper, journals, or tv's\nheadlines. Most of the discussions are disputes of the pros and cons about urban sprawl.\nSome like it, however many more people hate it. The critiques for sprawling include:\nencroach the agriculture lands and open spaces, increase the infrastructure cost, separate\nsocial groups, cause downtown in ellipse, etc. The arguments from the sprawl supporters\ninclude: provide people American Dream (suburban house), increase suburban land value\nand taxations, access to the greens, etc. Different understandings are given to \"sprawl\" as\nneeded. If there exists a best word to describe these discussions and studies about urban\nsprawl, it should be \"mess\".\nExisting study strategy\nResearches noticed that to make the discussion meaningful, a clear definition and\nmeasurement are needed. A classic paper in this field was written by George Galster et al.\nin 2001: \"Wrestling Sprawl to the ground: Defining and Measuring and Elusive Concept\".\nThey regarded urban sprawl as an inefficient land use pattern. This recognition is being\naccepted by more and more researchers. According to the definition, Galster et al.'s\nproposed to measure sprawl by measuring 8 indexes: measuring proximity, density,\ncontinuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity, mix uses, of land use patterns.\nCritique of Existing study strategy\nLand use patterns contain not only developed lands (by human activities), but also\nundeveloped lands, such as mountains, lakes, rivers, deserts. Thus using Galster et al.'s\nmethod, we are measuring a composite of natural landscapes and human developments.\nAs we normally regard urban sprawl as the results from human activities, Galster et al.'s\nmeasuring will not capture the real features of urban sprawl.\nProposed solution\nWe propose to measure sprawl by measuring the spatial features of land use patterns\nwhose landscape differences are controlled. That is to say, we will measure the features\nof human development activities, instead of the natural environment. The technique used\n\nto accomplish this task is Cartogram. Using Cartogram we can maintain some features of\nmap data by transforming it. After equalizing all the places' construction cost, the land\nuse map contains only the differences of human developments. The spatial measurements\nbased on this kind of cartogram-processed data will provide us a more realistic image of\nurban sprawl.\nPlease read the articles below and consider the following questions to discuss on Tuesday.\nDiscussion questions:\n1. What are the main differences between Galster et al.'s sprawl definition and the\nprevious definitions? What are your ideals about how to define urban sprawl?\n2. What is Galster et al.'s sprawl measurement strategy? How do you think of it? Do\nyou have any new ideas about how to measure sprawl?\n3. What is Cartogram? What are its major applications? How to produce a cartogram\nfor an existing map data?\n4. What are the advantages and disadvantages to use cartogram-processed data for\nsprawl measuring?"

However, for urban growth there is a general agreement that it will\noccur, that it needs some type of management. As a result, the governments of a growing\nnumber of jurisdictions have imposed some growth management measures to influence\nthe pattern of growth. This session will, at first, discuss the management options faced by\nplanners, such as Caps on development, restrictive zoning limits on allowable densities,\nurban growth boundaries, and long permit-processing delays, etc.\nNew problem arises with growth management efforts. Too little constrain encourages\nsprawl while excessive land restrictions limit the land available for development, forcing\nland and housing prices sharply higher. This dilemma makes it particularly difficult for\ncommunities to plan to meet future housing needs C one of the most important functions\nthey must perform.\nSo the formulation of growth management policies implementation tools requires timely\ninformation on the interactions of government policies and land markets. The success of\nthe new relationship will depend on communities knowing what they already have and\nwhat they are likely to need in the years and decades to come. The most useful way of\ndoing this is by creating a land market monitoring system to estimate and continuously\nmonitor development capacity and land demand.\n'Land Market Monitoring' is a phrase that describes the processes that can be employed\nby governments to monitor residential and other land uses within a jurisdiction. Done\nproperly and updated regularly, land market monitoring approaches can improve\nplanning by shedding light on the impacts of urban growth management policies, the\ncurrent and future availability of development capacity, and assist in balancing residential\ndevelopment near centers of current or future employment.\n\nThis session will concentrate on the role that information technology can play in a land\nmarket monitoring program providing some cases in different perspectives and how the\nadvancements in planning technologies, such as GIS and RDBMS, can enable\ncommunities to improve the practice of urban growth management.\nPlease read the articles below and consider the following questions to discuss on Tuesday.\nDiscussion questions:\n1. To what extent do different growth management approaches really restrict the\namount, pace, or location of growth? To what extent are the resulting supply\nrestrictions reflected in land and housing price?\n2. How do you think of the growth management- land and housing price interaction?\nWhats the main reason?\n3. Is land market monitoring the only way to balance growth management efforts? What\nelse?\n4. What differences can information knowledge make to better understanding of the\nland markets?\n5. How can the overall structure, as well as specific tools, shown in the UMI project be\nused in land market monitoring?"

The ability to process, manage, and update large amounts of\ninformation efficiently is an invaluable asset for local governments. Whether for urban\nplanning, tax assessment, or infrastructural development, municipalities require fast and\neasy access to map and associated data in an automated system. Further, they need to be\nable to analyze these data to meet increasing service demands.\nIller Bank is the main organization that gives financial and technical support for\nurbanization related services such as creating maps, developing urban plans, delivering\nwater, wastewater and solid waste services for all municipalities in Turkey. The Bank has\nthe biggest spatial data archives because it is the unique authority to approve all kinds of\nmaps of urban areas in the country.\nBut over time, the working system has not been updated or renewed and it becomes\ninsufficient to meet all the needs of municipalities. In other words, its working system is\nbehind the latest technological developments. So, it is necessary to update its working\nsystem according to contemporary progress.\n\nGIS can play a very important role both in delivering public services and in improving\nthe working system of Iller Bank to guide urban and infrastructural development more\nefficiently in Turkey. But developing a GIS is a complex process. It requires\nreconciliation of diverse source materials, conversion of paper maps and other hard copy\ndata, and the acquisition of new data, hardware and software, and user applications. In the\nprocess, management structure could be redefined, work flow could be redesigned, and\npersonnel should be trained.\nThe advantages of GIS: GIS has many advantages in the managements of spatial\nproblems. According to Nedovic-Budic (1999) the efficiency of an information system\ndepends on two dimensions: information quality and system quality (p. 286). In the case\nof information quality first, GIS system needs accurate data and it combines different\ndata sources. With existing data, advanced analysis such as modeling of a real world,\nenvironmental impact assessment and suitability analysis can be done and their results\ncan be visualized. In this way, system produces information as an output. Because of\nused data and produced information, the system becomes more reliant and transparent.\nMoreover, as Nedovic-Budic (1999) has noted, \"User satisfaction has been used as one of\nthe most prominent measures of system success and effectiveness\" (p. 287). In this\ncontext, GIS supply user friendly environment. More complex operations can be handled\nin a simple way. Users of the system are satisfied with the high quality of visual outputs.\nIn addition to this, a decision making process becomes more transparent and reliant,\nbecause of powerful analysis of GIS and everyone can follow everything in that system\neasily. Staff and managers can be more productive in this environment. GIS also has\nmany effects on organizations in which it is used. Nedovic-Budic (1999) claimed that\n\"Efficiency and effectiveness are the criteria used to evaluate how information systems\naffect organizational performance\" (p. 288). First of all, it decreases the inputs and\nincreases the outputs in order to supply the same amount of services. For example, while\noperating costs and numbers of staff are reduced, work volumes, product qualities, goal\nachievement and service effectiveness increase. As a result of all these advantages,\norganizations can return their investments with increased revenues. Finally, GIS brings\nequity, participation and transparency to society. Because people, politicians, managers\nand citizens are aware of their situation, they can participate in deciding their priorities,\nneeds and quality of services. In this way, GIS plays an important role in community\ndevelopment as a whole.\nExamples: In order to establish GIS in the working system of Iller Bank, it is useful to\nknow other countries' experiences. For this reason, the United States and Australia,\nwhich have been using these systems at advanced levels for many years were selected as\nexamples. Smith, Campbell, Subramanian, Bird and Nelson (2001) analyzed GIS\nexperiences in municipalities in United States. The municipalities used GIS in the\nestablishment of municipal information systems. Their starting point was preparation of\nthe strategic plan for the municipal information systems. After three years, they evaluate\n\nthe effectiveness of the system. According to authors' findings, GIS is very important in\nall land related operations. Moreover it has a very important role in delivering public\nservices, in management of governmental operations and in organizational controls. But\nits success depends on organizational structure. In order to share information with other\nmunicipalities and other organizations, attention was drawn to create requirements for\nnational guidelines for combining common basic rules, policies and formats about the\nGIS. In addition, Maguire and Longley (2005) explained the development of spatial data\ninfrastructure (SDI) as a common national GIS guideline which was coined in 1993 under\nthe coordination of U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC). According to\nthem \"FGDC defines SDI as the totality of 'technology, policies, standards, human\nresources, and related activities necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain,\nand preserve spatial data throughout all levels of government, the private and non-profit\nsectors, and academia'\" (p. 5). According to Harvey (2003), the roles of local\ngovernments are very important in developing national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI).\nThey are producers and end users of the data. Therefore, NSDI should be based on local\ngovernments.\nJacoby, Smith, Ting and Williamson (2002) emphasized Australian experiences about the\nSDI over the last decade. They underlined the problems of using different data sets and\nthe requirements of state SDI. According to them, \"[the] objective of SDIs is to ensure\nusers of spatial data will be able to acquire consistent datasets to meet their requirements\"\n(p. 307). All these studies show that common spatial data infrastructure is necessary for\nsharing data and information to reduce redundancy. One guideline could be developed for\nall countries.\nExpectations from the class discussion: This topic will be studying during the whole\nacademic year. For this reason, in order to guide this research in an efficient way, the\nfollowings will be expected from the participants of the discussion:\n1. Is there any Iller Bank kind of organization in US?\nWhat are the similarities and differences between them?\n2. What are the possibilities and obstacles in current situation in Iller Bank for\nthe use of GIS?\n\n3. What kind of opportunity can GIS bring to the Bank?\n4. Can GIS facilitate the change in Iller Bank?"

Introduction\nThe way planners gather and analyze information is archaic and extremely expensive.\nIt has been this way for decades, and unlike other industries, it does not seem to be\ngetting cheaper. Until the planning information systems community addresses this\nproblem in a holistic manner, data-based analysis will never fulfill its potential to inform\nurban planning.\nFew ever dispute the common folklore that 80-percent of any analysis effort is spent\ngathering data, leaving 20-percent of one's resources for the actual work that needs to\nget done. This is not a new realization. At least ten years ago we believed that the rapid\nincrease in GIS adoption, and the ubiquity of data in electronic form, would lead to\nlower data sharing costs (Obermeyer and Perloff 1994). However, there is no evidence\nthat this occurred. In fairness, the quality and quantity of the data brought to bear on a\nproblem has improved dramatically, but the most important factor--the relevance of\nanalysis in the decision making process, leaves much to be desired. The reason is simple.\nAnalysis is not timely. For example, if it takes years to assemble the data for a large\nenvironmental impact study, is it not likely that the analysis will be irrelevant before it is\npresented? And once this analysis is put in front of decision makers, how extensive is\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 8\ntheir ability to provide feedback? Can someone propose, for example, an alternative\neconomic strategy based on tourism instead of riverboat gambling and generate a new,\n1,000-page report? Or is stakeholder feedback relegated to meetings and minutes, never\nbeing explicitly linked to the numbers it discusses?\nThis thesis argues that our data gathering practices are broken, and are not likely to\nimprove until significant structural changes are made to urban information management\nsystems. The traditional areas in which we focus our research--data modeling, analysis,\nand visualization--are developed far beyond the capacity of practitioners to use them.\nThe software that does such a good job with those tasks does little to facilitate basic data\nacquisition and processing. We have for too long overlooked the medieval data gathering\npractices common at all levels of government. Corporations have moved into the 21st\ncentury with integrated information systems that connect businesses with upstream and\ndownstream trading partners, so that data is no longer re-processed when it moves from\none organization to another. The planning community, on the other hand, still operates\nlike traders at a bazaar, making deals, bartering, mixing and matching the data sources\nthat form the foundation of our analytic systems.\nImproving the flow of data between and within organizations is the next great\nchallenge for planning support systems (PSS). With the sheer quantity of information\nsources available to planners increasing every year, and the dramatic technology\ninvestments made in the late 1990s, this is an especially important time to re-examine the\nability of information technology to inform decision making in planning. What we really\nmust do is re-evaluate what it means to be in the practice of creating planning support\nsystems. It does not mean to combine theory, data and a methodology into a plan of\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 9\naction for a specific place and time. It means to create systems that provide stakeholders\nwith the ability to continuously make plans (Hopkins 1999), have them pre-empted by\nothers' actions, and re-plan based on the new conditions. A system that did this would\ntruly aid the decision making process and completely change the debate around how\ninformation and specialists are used in the planning process.\nMotivation and Background\nOver the last ten years, few technologies have captured the interest and energy of\ninformation technology professionals like XML1 and Web services. Recently the fruits of\nthis investment have been seen in public-facing applications like new interfaces to the\ndatabases of Google and Amazon. But perhaps more important are the XML and Web\nservice-driven applications buried in the corporate back-office IT infrastructure,\nseamlessly connecting them with their business partners, and allowing them to achieve\noperational efficiencies that were barely imaginable in the 1980s. This is how Amazon\ncan sell you a used book from a small, independent bookstore in Allentown, PA for two\ndollars and still make a profit. This is how Wal-Mart can continuously adjust their prices\nand inventories to meet changing supply and demand and respond to the vagaries of\nconsumer preference. What can planners learn from Amazon? That question is central to\nthis thesis.\n\n1 All acronyms are defined in Appendix B.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 10\nLeveraging important technology trends\nThe research agenda of this paper is inextricably linked to a number of fundamental\nchanges happening in how government collects, stores and distributes data, and how\nInternet-aware software is built. While planning cannot adopt corporate technology\nwholesale, we do not have the financial resources to develop our own basic technologies\nfrom scratch, like the military industry. This puts us in the precarious position of\nstrategically choosing which technologies to adopt from other fields, and which ones we\nshould develop ourselves. I list here some of the trends I believe PSS must follow and\nadopt to be successful in the next few decades.\nAn urban information explosion. There is more to solving planning issues than\nsimply obtaining the right data, but it is certainly fair to say that information plays a key\nrole in an effective planning support system. What exactly is this role? How do we\nconceptualize our information processing requirements? These issues are more\nimportant than ever as we enter an era where almost every device will have the capacity\nto contribute to the city's information undercurrent. The new standard for Internet\naddressing, IPv6, was created to greatly increase the number of IP addresses available in\nresponse to industry's desire to give unique Internet IDs to devices other than full-\nfledged computers. This standard is already in place and in use. Wireless Internet access\nis becoming increasingly common and is beginning to play a role in public sector\ncomputing (Muniwireless 2004). Hardware for wireless Internet access is less than $10 as\nof June, 2004. These three trends taken together make it probable that even low-cost\ndevices such as phones, cameras, buses, watches, traffic sensors, air quality monitors, etc.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 11\nwill be Internet-aware and addressable in the near future, leading to an exponential\nincrease the quantity of information available about the urban landscape.\nGeographic data sharing and systems interoperability. Efforts to standardize\nthe way in which we describe geographic features are critical to our ability to share\ngovernment data between different departments, levels of government, and commercial\nand educational institutions. For example, if all municipalities called parcels by the same\nname and used the same terminology--and meaning--for a parcel's attributes, the cost\nof regional planning and administrative operations would be greatly reduced. In Europe,\nthe problem has been less acute as most data collection occurs at the federal level.\nTherefore, work in this area is mainly happening in North America, where there is a\nstrong tradition of local independence from federal control. The U.S Federal Geographic\nData Committee and ESRI have strong programs in place to promote a common\ndescription of the most basic data sets used in government.\nOf equal importance is the ability to locate and ingest another party's data with little\nor no human intervention in the conversion process. This is systems interoperability. The\nOpenGIS Consortium's standards for geographic data encoding (GML/Geography\nMarkup Language), geographic data publishing (WFS/Web Feature Service), and map\npublishing (WMS/Web Mapping Service) are being well received in the industry and\nprovide one of the foundations upon which this work depends.\nXML. Arguably the most disruptive technology since the advent of the World Wide\nWeb is Extensible Markup Language, or XML. XML is really nothing by itself. It is\nsimply a framework in which to write highly structured languages for describing things\nand passing messages between computers. It is also very important that XML languages\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 12\nare plain text, so that their content is transparent to humans, even in the absence of\ncomputer programs that can read and manipulate the XML. This has a profound effect\non people's trust in the content and in the ability of the content to be used in almost all\ncurrent and future computing environments.\nWeb services. \"Web services\" is an umbrella term to describe systems that allow\napplications to communicate between computers using XML as a messaging language.\nThe different communication implementation strategies go by many names (the most\nwell known being SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol). However, the\nimplementation strategies are not important in this context. What is most important is\nthat all Web services strategies use a well-known and widely implemented Internet\nprotocol for communication--HTTP--the foundation upon which all Web sites\noperate. While some technologists decry the drawbacks of the Web protocol, the\nadvantages are numerous. The most obvious is that most organizations already have a\nWeb infrastructure in place, so implementing Web services can be handled in a familiar\nway, and the wealth of Web software can be used to develop and run new Web service-\nbased applications. The other important aspect of Web services is that they use XML for\npassing messages between computers, preserving the transparency that has made XML\nso popular and useful (although some implementations, most notably those promoted by\nMicrosoft in their .NET framework, often still hide the actual message content (data) in\na non-human readable format).\nWhether or not XML is better than other technologies, the software industry has\nquickly supported it, building powerful, reliable tools to read XML and develop Web\nServices on every operating system and application in common use. Perhaps the\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 13\nstrongest sign of XML's importance is that Microsoft, which does not have a strong\nreputation for encouraging interoperability with others' applications, has decided to base\ntheir enterprise development software on Web Services, and has changed the native file\nformats of Office documents to XML.\nReflecting on the science of GIS\nHow do we explain geographical phenomena through the application of appropriate methods of\nanalysis, and models of physical and human processes? Under what circumstances is the scientist willing\nto trust data that he or she did not collect, and will the increased technological ability to share scientific\ndata over the Internet...change them? Such questions about tools often have their roots in theoretical\nquestions about appropriate representations, operations, and concepts.\n--Goodchild, et al., IJGIS 1999\nThese fundamental questions are posed in a 1999 article co-authored by many of the\nelder states-people of the field, including Mike Goodchild, Max Egenhofer and Karen\nKemp. One might suppose that thirty years into the evolution of GIS these issues would\nhave been discussed in great depth. Yet the article introduces an initiative funded by the\nNational Science Foundation, Project Varenius, which seeks to build the theoretical\nfoundation of geographic information sciences that was neglected during decades of\npractice-oriented work.\nThis project, while concretely grounded in a prototype implementation, fits well into\nthe research agenda expressed by Project Varenius. It provides a set of circumstances\nunder which scientists (and engineers and planners) can share data and collaborate on\nanalysis. We do not hope to provide the definitive solution--that will take years of work\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 14\nby our community of researchers. The main goal is to encourage the field to step back\nand address fundamental, broad-based data management problems that must not be left\nto the fields of management information and computer sciences.\nAn Organizational Theory of Planning Support Systems\nThe field of planning support systems is defined as, \"a conception of integrated\nsystems of information and software which bring the three components of traditional\ndecision support systems--information, models, and visualization--into the public\nrealm\" (Klosterman 1999). While Klosterman's three components have been well\nresearched over the last two decades, work on integration has not received proper\nattention, especially in regard to the organizational setting through which information\nflows. This section discusses the dominant information management paradigms planners\ncurrently use, and the primary ways researchers have attempted to address shortcomings\nin the effectiveness of collaborative information systems. We see a mismatch between\nthe problems we would like to solve, and the strategies employed to solve them, and we\nposit that this is why truly effective solutions have proven elusive. To address these\nsystemic problems, it may be necessary to develop a technology strategy based upon a\ndifferent theory of information sharing across organizations. This section develops such\na theory, which informs the technology framework that is the topic of this work.\nDominant information management paradigms\nThe most basic information management paradigm is the single user system, where\neveryone manages their own copy of information for their own purposes. This strategy\nquickly falls apart in organizational settings, where productivity gains can be had by\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 15\ncentralizing data collection and management activities. This leads to a situation where\ndata are in one place, and users are in many other places. This problem has been\naddressed using client-server information architectures. The central principle here is that\ndata resides on a server, and multiple, heterogeneous clients all access a particular data\nset from that server. Over the past few decades this strategy has worked well. It fits (and\nperhaps has even influenced) the structure of many organizations, who try to centralize\nspecialized activities like information technology in one department. Data producers are\nable to write, or publish, data into the centralized database server (data entry or\npublishing clients), and data users are able to read data out of the centralized system.\nThere is no direct connection between data producers and users in this type of setup.\nThe client-server strategy is usually only employed within a single organization,\nbecause allowing users direct access to one's database is a potential security problem, and\nthe system often requires some training and knowledge on the part of the user. In the\n1990s, Web-based clients came into vogue. Data was more secure--database\nconnection information was hidden from the user and buried in the Web server, and the\ndatabase accessed through the Web was usually a duplicate, expendable version. Data\nusage and interpretation was also made simpler by using the increasingly familiar\nmetaphor of the Web page for information presentation and manipulation. The security\nadvantages of Web-based systems are clear, but the benefits of Web-based client\nsoftware is less so. In the 1990s, when these technologies were being developed, users\noften had little experience with computing, so the Web strategy made sense. But in the\nnear future, if not today, information users will have a sophisticated understanding of\nsoftware user interfaces, and feel limited by the simplicity of Web-based clients. So while\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 16\nWeb-based clients have taught us a lot about addressing security concerns, Web pages\nmay be reaching the limits of their usefulness as client software. Also, the Web has little\nto tell us about collaboration. The client-server paradigm has not changed, so there is no\nreason to expect the traditional Web server-Web page architecture to lead to\nrevolutionary advances in information management and collaboration.\nGeographic information sharing research\nThere already exists a strong body of literature in the area of geographic information\nsharing. The traditional line of inquiry researchers often take is to examine existing\norganizations and their efforts at collaboration (Evans, 1997) in an attempt to\nunderstand why goals are not better met. The most general problem is that\norganizational settings are highly complex. When embarking on an information sharing\nproject, many issues may arise, such as reluctance to share GIS files due to a fear of\nlosing autonomy, control over information sources, independence, organizational power,\ncost, complex inter-organizational interdependencies, and politics (Nedovic-Budic and\nPinto, 1999-2, 54). Solutions to these problems usually address the social, political and\norganizational problems using an existing technology, or at best a new technology within\nan existing paradigm. On the other hand, research in planning support systems is usually\ngeared towards technology that advances the state of the art in one of Klosterman's\nthree pillars, with no formal attention devoted to how the technology addresses\norganizational issues. By considering technology fixed, information sharing researchers\nare led to false conclusions. For example, it has been found that the information sharing\nsuccess is found when the parties have aligned interests and work well together. What\nabout those organizations who do not have well-aligned goals; do we expect them to\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 17\nnever collaborate successfully? Is this an acceptable situation in planning? If we can only\nexpect to build successful information sharing systems in that type of environment, we\ncan never expect to change the balance of the 80-20 data management-analysis split.\nPositioning PSS in the Theory of the Firm\nWe believe that technology research can do more to aid information sharing than the\ncurrent dominant information management paradigms allow. Above all other problems,\nthe geographic information sharing research community identifies cost as the main\nbarrier to successful projects. While some people express a desire to collaborate\nmotivated by altruism and efficient government, the cost in time, resources, and money\nto one's own organization, in conjunction with the value derived, most often determines\nparticipation and long-term success (Nedovic-Budic and Pinto 1999-1). So then if\neconomic concerns drive behavior, then traditional economic theory should have much\nto offer the urban planning field. From this perspective, we can restate the information\nsharing problem as one in which the costs of the system must be less than the benefits.\nWe know that the costs of data management and sharing are high enough so that the\nliterature advises us that the benefits must be very high to achieve successful outcomes.\nThe goal of technology work in this area is therefore distilled to a simple principle. The\nlower the cost of participation in a system, the less an organization must benefit from\nparticipation. And as benefits increase, so can cost. A large state organization whose\nmandate is information delivery can spend a great deal of money to accomplish this goal.\nHowever, a small non-profit whose primary mission is economic development and\nhousing has limited time, resources and interest to devote to the issue. Yet both these\ngroups, and many in between, must be accommodated within the same framework if the\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 18\ntechnology of information sharing is to address the entire community that planners must\nserve.\nMany in our field are uncomfortable with comparing government to corporate\noperations because of their different goals and motivations. However, they are more\nsimilar than different, as private sector firms have information management demands\n(and standards) at least as high as state and local government. We can learn a great deal\nfrom the business literature if we simply agree that both private and public agencies are\ngroups of people organized to accomplish certain tasks in a cost-effective manner. Such\nis the case whether the tasks performed are part of a beer advertising campaign or a\njourney-to-work study. This viewpoint is not novel. Our term of art, planning support\nsystems (PSS), is a direct descendant of the corporate term, decision support systems\n(DSS), that came into vogue in the 1980s (Klosterman 1999), and most researchers have\nbelieved for a long time that GIS should ultimately be part of MIS (Obermeyer and\nPinto 1994). So we have always looked to our larger corporate brethren for guidance on\nhow to use information to our advantage. In upcoming chapters we update that strategy\nand seek to assimilate PSS into the mainstream of distributed information technology,\nbut here we provide the theoretical foundation needed to choose the right technology.\nThe theory presented here is built up by first specifying a strict definition of the\ntypes of roles information plays in planning support systems. Then, we propose a way to\napproach the problems conceptually. The only assumption made is that organizational\nbehavior is the lens through which these problems should be viewed. Other issues, such\nas technology, are secondary to this. By developing an understanding of the nature of\nplanning-related information and the organizational behaviors we must encourage to\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 19\nimprove our systems, a framework for PSS information management can then be\ndeveloped.\nPSS from an information processing perspective\nMost planning support systems are reticent to admit that their purpose is to quantify\nplanning problems. Instead their proponents hedge, stating that they are no more than a\nplatform for public debate. If the creators of these systems really felt that way, would\nthey put so much thought into their methodology, and effort into data processing? Or is\nit rather the case that most analyses have such a short shelf life that their cost must be\njustified in some other way than their ability to provide answers? I would argue that it is\nthe latter, and whether it is called an answer, or a model, or a simplification of a complex\nsystem, anyone working in the field of PSS must operate under the assumption that they\nare creating systems that process data into more easily comprehensible information to\nhelp people interpret a complex reality that is beyond the ability of any single individual,\ncorporation or special interest group to understand.\nPlanning support systems do provide answers through a process that quantifies most\ninputs, but they are always going to be at an intermediate level. They are no substitute\nfor decisions. Therefore the PSS primarily exists to process information in ways that make\nit easier for people to make decisions--to understand issues and engage in highly\ninformed debate, ideally in a collaborative environment. This is not to say that the\nanalysis and presentation of information is not important, just that those functions are\nwell studied, and advanced far beyond our ability to populate them with useful data (in\nfact, if this work is successful, someone might be writing ten years from now that PSS\nshould be seen as an information presentation tool, because they will take for granted the\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 20\nrichness of information available for presentation). But no analysis or presentation or\npublic participation can happen without a rich warehouse of information upon which to\nwork.\nThe complexity of modern cities contributed to the need for the profession of\nplanning, so it should be apparent that the information systems planners use should help\ncope with this complexity. Although we are in an, \"information rich era in which high\nvolumes of data flow through ubiquitous communication networks (Evans and Ferreira\n1995), current practices are not able to make use of it, at least not in a cost-effective\nmanner. In fact, organizations usually resist distributed processing efforts (Meredith\n1995), leading to high project costs with little return. This problem will likely become\neven more noticeable as we try to take advantage of all the environmental sensing\nequipment embedded in the urban landscape, from security cameras to camera phones\nand location-tracked transit vehicles, the data sources we can and should incorporate\ninto PSS will increase exponentially in the near future.\nIt is difficult to argue against the current systems, because the lack of any universal\npractice or system is more notable than anything else. How do planners manage data?\nBasically they acquire it, process it in some idiosyncratic way to get it into their database.\nWhile there are some standard software packages in use, and plenty of \"best practices\"\navailable to cite, there are precious few ubiquitous practices. When practices become\nubiquitous and generic enough that unrelated organizations can develop connections\nbetween their information systems, we have achieved interoperability. And that is the point\nof this work, to define the general, interoperable, practices that software packages must\nimplement if we are to have any hope of making better use of the information available\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 21\ntoday, and the immense increase in quantity and disparity of information that will be\navailable tomorrow.\nThe primary raw material needed to create an analysis product is information. This\ninformation could be obtained by developing in-house data gathering capabilities, but the\ncost of that effort is beyond most organizations. Imagine sending teams of city planners\n(even if they were graduate students) out into the field to count traffic, go door to door\nasking people how much money they make, or how much they paid for their house. Why\ndo this when organizations like the assessing department, the US Census Bureau, the\nBureau of Labor Statistics, the realtor's Multiple Listing Service, and the actuarial\ndatabases of all kinds of insurance companies already have the information? It makes\nmuch more sense to form partnerships with these groups, and only develop custom data\nsets when absolutely necessary. For this reason, the production of planning analysis depends\nupon inputs from multiple, disparate suppliers.\nSo ultimately, to make use of a large body of data, it will be necessary to work with\nmultiple, disparate suppliers. But it may be easier to start by looking only at the case of a\nmunicipal planning effort using solely municipal data sources. What is the private sector\nanalog to a town? Is a town a firm or a conglomerate? This is where things get slightly\ncomplicated. Most of a town planner's information providers are other municipal\nagencies, such as property assessing, building permitting or zoning, so it is tempting to\nlook at municipal government as one firm with different departments that support the\ndevelopment of different products, like tax bills, parking tickets, police officers, drinking\nwater, etc. However, in practice a government bureaucracy operates more like a\nmultidivisional firm than a company in the normal sense.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 22\nMultidivisional, or M-form, firms have many unique characteristics, but for our\npurposes the critical one is that the reward and decision making systems are constrained\nwithin a division, so that there is little incentive for one division to act in the best\ninterests of another (Carlton and Perloff 1990). Some opportunities are lost this way, but\nat least the organization does not collapse under its own weight (Ba and Stallaert 2002).\nAt the state and federal level, this probably makes a lot of sense because the information\nand coordination required to operate such large organizations is overwhelming, but\nmunicipalities may be emulating their larger relatives, without much thought paid to the\nreason. This theory suggests that one solution to this problem (and perhaps to many\nother problems) could be to institute more hierarchical forms of local and county\ngovernment so that all divisions operate under a unified risk and reward structure.\nHowever, the task at hand is to redesign information systems, not government. So we\nwill work within the given institutional parameters, which suggest that it is best to\nconsider a local government as a multidivisional firm, and that it will stay that way in the\nfuture.\nSo town planners cannot count on other departments to act as partners in the\ncreation of their product. In other words, the assessing department has little to gain from\nreducing costs in the planning department. We are left with a situation where, from an\nownership perspective (either as a stockholder or taxpayer), we would like to see our\ngovernment maximize production across all divisions (e.g. assess property values and\nundertake planning analysis). However, the organizational structure cannot change, and\nby the definition of a multidivisional firm, the highest levels of the firm are not provided\nwith enough information to tell the divisions exactly what to do. This is a vexing problem,\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 23\nand I believe it provides a good model of reality. In fact, this may be why we have so\nmuch trouble developing effective planning support systems--because we believe the\ngovernment to operate like a single, unified firm.\nWhen faced with the question of how to incorporate property value information into\na planning support system, the PSS community has generally addressed the technical\nissues and assumed away the organizational ones. This would be fine if the\norganizational issues could be treated in isolation, but they are intertwined with\ntechnology. For example, since the 1990s, the trend in GIS has been to put data into an\n\"enterprise\" warehouse. \"Enterprise\" means that the data maintained by an organization\n(enterprise) resides in a centrally maintained database, with clients connecting over a\nnetwork, and accessing those data sets a database administrator has granted them\npermission to use. This is fine as an intra-divisional solution, but the M-form theory\nsuggests that enterprise databases find it difficult to cross divisions, and therefore\nenterprise solutions do little to address information management issues that cross\ndivisional boundaries (Carlton and Perloff 1990). The theory is borne out by recent\nempirical data such as the following example. In a recent survey of 110 companies with\nrevenue of at least $500 million, only 23% had their entire firm using one instance of\nERP (enterprise resource planning) software.2 And in one extreme example, as many as\n400 different versions of a single vendor's ERP software were in use at a single, large\ncompany (Kock 2004).\n\n2 ERP is a term used to describe the process of managing an organization. The software usually keeps track of\ncompany-wide information regarding employees, facilities, etc. Unlike software used to achieve business objectives\n(like customer relationship management software), which might naturally be specialized for certain divisions or\nfunctions, one would expect enterprise resource planning operations to be easily centralized.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 24\n\nExamining local government from the perspective of an M-form, or multidivisional\nfirm, provides some insight into past information management failings, but remember\nthat a discussion of a municipality's relationship to other organizations was postponed. It\nis now quite easy to return to that issue, because our theory already considers different\ndivisions as basically acting like different firms. Conceptualizing government as a\nmultidivisional firm makes it easy to incorporate other levels of government, non-\ngovernmental entities, and even private firms. And later it will be shown that the theory\nsuits not only the case when the analyst is a government entity, but the more realistic\ncase when the analyst is a private entity working in loose collaboration with government,\ntheir own firm, and the public. There is no change required at the broadest theoretical\nlevel, although in practice minor differences will emerge--most likely around tighter data\nprivacy requirements and perhaps higher costs and information licensing restrictions.\nWhile the differences between separate firms and different divisions within the same\nfirm might be important in some ways, for the purposes of looking at how they share\nand process information, it is most useful to consider their relationship to be that of\ntrading partners.\nThe way trading partners exchange information is by executing a contract. This is a\ntremendously important point. A contract is a specification of all the rules governing a\nbusiness transaction between parties. A contract is needed when the parties doing\nbusiness cannot count on each other to maximize performance without one (this is\nbasically any time when the two parties have different bosses). The contract must\nanticipate and specify what happens in all possible scenarios, because if you could count\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 25\non the parties to behave properly in a situation not covered by the contract, the contract\nwould not have been needed in the first place. While subcontracting and outsourcing\ncontinue to be cost-effective ways of doing business, this description of contracts begins\nto suggest how they can become quite expensive.\nThe cost of doing business with outside parties is addressed in a number of\norganizational behavior theories, most notably \"Agency Theory\" and \"Transaction Cost\nTheory\" (Vibert 2004). These theories help us decide when to outsource and when to\nkeep a function in-house. Transaction costs have been identified as a key factor in\ngeographic information sharing (Nedovic-Budic 1999), and being able to accurately\npredict these costs, and develop contractual agreements that govern the process, help\nensure project success. Overall, cross-organization information sharing can achieve\neconomies of scale, so planners should continue to outsource their data development\nneeds, but these theories tell us that we still must put contracts in place. Even when\ncross-agency cooperation seems strong, tools like Memorandums of Understanding\n(MOUs) should be employed to ensure good results. What should these MOUs contain?\nThis is where PSS research can inform policy. No treatment of planning support systems is\ncomplete without attention paid to the rules by which information is transacted across agencies. Either\nthis policy work must be done for every PSS proposed, or the PSS must leverage a\nbroader technology framework that has already accounted for these issues. This subtle\ninterplay between technology and policy is a large part of the motivation for this work.\nFraming the Issues from a Firm's Perspective\nWith a basic theory in place about PSS and its place in local government, we can\nbegin to address the problems raised in the introduction. Planning analysis still has\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 26\nrelatively little influence on development when compared to highly deterministic tools\nlike zoning and the transportation manual, which seem to single-handedly (along with\ndevelopers' interpretation/manipulation of them) shape urban form. But we cannot seek\nto emulate zoning or engineering manuals. They are different kinds of tools. They are\none generation downstream, offering patterns or heuristics to follow. We must operate\nupstream, providing the guidance by which these heuristics are created, or by which they\nare accepted or rejected at the time of decision making.\nData, data, data\nIn real estate, the three most important characteristics of a property are location,\nlocation and location. Planning analysts have a similar love affair, but with data. Urban\nenvironments have become such incredibly complex organisms that no single person or\nagency has enough knowledge to make responsible decisions. Instead we rely on a web\nof specialized disciplines to build and maintain the databases and analytic tools we bring\nto bear on planning problems. The cost of gathering and processing this data is arguably\nthe most significant cost for planning analysis. In rare cases, one might undertake one's\nown data collection effort, such as a survey. But this only happens in research\nenvironments. The general case is one where practicing planners build their analysis\naround data that is readily available, and unless society develops the willingness to fund\nplanning research (like we do in defense), this will continue to be the case. The point\nhere is that planners are not data producers. We operate like traders at a bazaar, making\ndeals, bartering, mixing and matching the data sources that build our analytic systems. I\nhope I have evoked a mental image of planners shuttling between medieval tents on\nmuddy roads, because that is the state of civic information systems.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 27\nInformation technology has certainly brought significant improvements to the speed\nand cost of creating and maintaining data, but we are still far from being good at\nbringing information to bear on a problem at the precise time when decisions are being\nmade. In most urban information systems data comes from a variety of public and\nprivate sources, and can quickly became outdated. In the case of government agencies,\nwhether at the federal, state, or local level, data is usually easy to acquire at any particular\npoint in time, but difficult to keep current at all times. We often try to supplement\ngovernment data with more current data from the private sector. For example, in urban\ngrowth studies, the most up to date source for new construction and land use is the\ndevelopers building them. But there are no generally accepted best practices for\nintegrating public and private data sources in a PSS, and without policy in place, we\ncannot expect anything more than ad hoc participation from the private sector.\nAgency theory suggests that the data provision issues can be improved by having the\nconcerned parties execute a contract specifying exactly the rules of engagement. This\nmay sound simple, but this type of contract is rare. Most data sharing agreements do a\ngood job of detailing what will be shared, but not how. This is probably because it is\nseen as going beyond the boundaries of politeness to tell another agency how to do their\njob. Yet who will tell them how to do it? In a multidivisional firm, we have learned that\nthe \"bosses\" are prevented from having enough information to do this, so the\nappropriate rules must come out of a negotiation process between the interested parties;\nin other words, a contract.\nSo what should the contract say? One could image, for example, a program that\ncould compare an old data set to a new one and make suitable updates. In this case, the\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 28\ncontract might say that a new data set will be provided whenever a change is made. If the\ndata are large, however, this could be a very wasteful way of doing things. It would make\nmore sense to write a piece of software that could receive messages telling it to update a\nparticular data set in a particular way. In this case, the contract could specify that the data\nprovider's software send messages to this new, smart piece of software. This puts a\nburden on the data provider, but the user could compensate them with the money saved\nfrom not having to do data updates any more. And the provider would be much more\nlikely to agree if they could re-use the updating system (and the contract) with other\nusers. Now the interplay between technology and policy should be becoming clear. In\norder for data users to solve their information management problems, they need to\ndevelop detailed, clear relationships with data providers. This clarity must be evident in\ncontractual terms, public policy, and technological execution.\nThe timing of decision making\nPlanning support systems, like decision support systems, are tools. Their intent is not\nto produce maps and figures for annual reports, but to be ready partners in the process\nof decision making. Fulfilling this role requires that PSS must be operated by stakeholders at\nthe time when decisions are being made. Current practice is for technicians to operate the\nsystem, and the usefulness of its results is usually tied closely to the time at which the\ndata were acquired, or the analyses were run. In the Buildout analysis, we will see that\nMassGIS valiantly attempts to address this issue by providing online access to the\nanalysis. This shows that they recognize the problem, but without up-to-date data, the\nfact that the analysis is available to a larger population does little to inform public debate.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 29\nAt this point in the discussion, many studies of planning information systems tend to\ndive into the contentious arena of public participation and get diverted by issues of\npolitics, power and class. \"Rational,\" information-based decision making processes\nmight be mentioned as a marginalized form of discourse, or even as a tool of the wealthy\nto erect a facade of objectivity around questionable decisions. This paper takes a slightly\ndifferent position, and suggests that people's main motivation to use rational scientific\nanalysis is honest; they genuinely believe in its power to inform good decisions. It is\nmore productive to take the position that our community of information scientists\nprovides the public realm with poor decision making tools. Our analytic methodologies are\nusually sound, but we have done little to adapt them to realistic decision making\nscenarios. Maybe the academic, prototyping environment in which our technologies are\ndeveloped are to blame, or maybe there is some other cause, but systems that depend\nupon pre-prepared, static data sets have extremely limited value. And there seems to be a\ntacit understanding of this, leading to a general dissatisfaction with most urban\ninformation systems. Doing nothing but improving the timing of analysis would\nrevolutionize the field, but achieving that goal requires the other changes discussed here\nas well.\nThe timing of expenditures\nA finance expert will tell you that the predictability and non-volatility of an expense\nis just as important as its actual amount. \"Lumpy\" expenses are bad, because it is\ndifficult to budget for them. The preference for stable receipts and payments can be seen\nin many facets of the economy. This is why companies are willing to pay more to lease\nequipment, and people can be driven bankrupt by an ill-timed job loss. Planners also can\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 30\nill afford lumpy expenses. We may go to our city council or governor and ask for a fourfold\nbudget increase, just for the next couple of years to develop a twenty year master plan,\nbut if conditions change, and in five years that plan is no longer valid, the money will not\nbe there to re-do the work. A world that changes in complex ways at unpredictable times\nrequires continuous planning and analysis. Yet the nature of public expenditures\ndemands constancy and predictability. So the cost of performing planning analysis must\nreconcile these conflicting forces. The Buildout analysis suffers greatly from this\nproblem. A great deal of good work is obsolete soon after it is complete. While policy\nmay take the lead on this issue, any technology work in the field should also be aware of\nthe importance of timing.\n\nResearch Question & Methods\nHow can planning take advantage of these cutting-edge technologies that are\nchanging the corporate IT landscape? This question motivates the research presented\nhere. Surely there are benefits to be had from the Web services paradigm of information\nflow, but do the benefits outweigh the costs of adoption? And as mentioned earlier, we\nmust be smart about how much we adopt, and how we adapt technology to fit the needs\nof government and urban planning.\nProving that the future of urban information systems lies within an XML/Web\nServices information paradigm is a difficult task at best--there are few tools or\nprecedents for proving the value of paradigm shift. Falling short of this, the best strategy\nis to position the field within a theoretical framework that helps explain why some issues\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 31\nare successfully handled, and others remain intractable problems. Starting from the\ntheoretical position put forth above, we make a strong case for Web services through\nhypothetical syllogism (Weston 1992, 51). We do this by showing that government\norganizational behavior is similar to corporate structures, and therefore that the solutions\ncorporations employed to successfully address information management and\ncollaboration issues can be employed in planning, which includes both governmental and\nprivate sector organizations.\nThesis Organization\nThis chapter introduced a vexing problem. We seem to be constantly progressing in\nour ability to capture, store and disseminate data, but our ability to manage and make\nefficient use of this information leaves much to be desired. The PSS literature focuses\ntoo heavily on the traditional specialties of data management, modeling and visualization,\npaying too little attention to their integration, or issues regarding implementation within\nan organization. On the other hand, the information sharing literature often takes\ntechnology as a given, and seeks to address information sharing and collaborative\nplanning issues from an organizational behavior perspective. We propose a blended\napproach. The major points made here about how organizations collaborate are that\ntransaction costs and the chain of command are important factors in the ability of\norganizations to function effectively. Executive managers must have very good\ninformation about the costs and benefits of different actions and outcomes if they hope\nto run their agency effectively. If an organization is too large (or inefficient) for\nexecutives to get the information needed to make these decisions, they must cede\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 32\ndecision making authority to lower levels. This makes small divisions effective, but\nmagnifies cross-divisional problems--exactly the situation we observe in government\ntoday.\nIn Chapter 2, modern, Internet-centric, distributed information technologies are\nreviewed with a focus on how they address information management problems. Chapter\n3 presents the Massachusetts buildout analysis, an urban growth model developed as part\nof the Community Preservation Initiative (CPI), an effort to better engage towns in\nplanning for growth management and open space preservation. The CPI is interesting in\nitself, and is discussed in more detail elsewhere (Hodges 2004), but here we look only at\nthe buildout analysis in its role as a practical tool with great potential, but limited\nusefulness, because it suffers from the problems predicted by the theories put forth in\nChapters 1 and 2.\nWith this background, we are able to design a new framework for urban information\nmanagement. Chapters 4 and 5 present solutions to common PSS requirements such as\ndata sharing, participatory decision making, and expert collaboration. These solutions are\nexpressed within a Web services framework, which uses a shared, formal, XML-based\nvocabulary called PAMML (Planning Analysis and Modeling Markup Language). The\nPAMML framework consists of a language in which abstract data sharing, transformations\n(arithmetic operations, format translations) and public feedback loops can be expressed, and\na suite of Web services that allow organizations to advertise their ability to perform\nspecific tasks, such as the transfer of a particular data set, or the execution of a particular\nspatial operation. The entire PAMML vocabulary is expressed in the XML Schema\nlanguage, and is listed in Appendix A.\n\nRaj R. Singh\nCollaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach\npage 33\nThe theoretical argument is strengthened by reference to an example of a real\nplanning support system being used in Massachusetts. Armed with a theory and an actual\nsystem that exhibits shortcomings common to its kind, the thesis presents a solution\nbased on XML and Web Services. As stated, there is no definitive way to unequivocally\nprove the system's value, but it is hoped that the preponderance of evidence presented\nhere should convince the reader that paradigm shift is worthwhile.\n\nRaj R.

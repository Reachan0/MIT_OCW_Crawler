To achieve the lasting impact necessary for true change to occur, sustainability needs to be holistically integrated throughout an academic program, leveraging the knowledge of instructors to create a more sustainability-literate population.\nThis resource presents materials associated with a four-week noncredit course intended to provide current and future educators with the knowledge and skills to infuse their lessons and practices with sustainability, along with a link to an online resource library designed to help educators find activities and lessons that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

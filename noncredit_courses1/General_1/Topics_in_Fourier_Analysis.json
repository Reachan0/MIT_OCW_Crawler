      "content": "TOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\n0. Introduction\nThis is a set of notes that I wrote for a course that I intended to but did not give\nat MIT during the spring semester of 2024. It covers a number of topics related to\nthe theory and application of Fourier analysis.\nI begin in §1 by proving the L2-convergence of Fourier followed by elementary\nresults about pointwise convergence for sufficiently smooth periodic functions. In\n§2 I discuss what goes wrong in the absence of periodicity, and in §3 I apply Fourier\nseries to compute the Riemann ζ at odd integers using the Bernoulli polynomials,\nwhich I also use to develop the Euler-Maclauren series. After comparing summa-\nbility methods in §4, I give a brief introduction in §5 to the summability results of\nDirichlet, Feij er, and Lebesgue.\nIn section §6 I introduce the L1-Fourier transform, followed in §7 by the compu-\ntation of the Fourier transforms of the Gauss and Poisson kernels and the derivation\nand application of the Poisson summation formula. The L1 version of the Fourier\ninversion formula is proved in §8. In §§9-11 I make preparations for my treatment\nin §12 of the L2-Fourier transform via Hermite functions. By the end of §12, I have\ncovered the key results in that theory: Parseval's identity and the Fourier inversion\nformula.\nIn §13 I introduce the test function space on which Laurent Schwartz based his\ntheory of tempered distributions. As was the case in my treatment of the L2-Fourier\ntransform, Hermite functions play a central role here. In §14 I give the definition of\nand do a few computations with tempered distributions, and in §15 I show how to\nextend continuous operations on the test function space as continuous operations\non tempered distributions.\nIn §§1-15 I have restricted my results to the one dimensional setting, and it is only\nin §16 that I describe what has to be done to extend those results to more than one\ndimension. Once I have done so, in §17 I introduce the weak topology on the space\nof Borel probability on RN, and in §18 I show that there is an intimate relationship\nbetween that topology and Fourier analysis. The results in §18 are combined with\nthose in §14 to derive in §19 the L evy-Khinchine formula for infinitely divisible\nprobability measures.\nThe rest of these notes is devoted to the theory of singular integral operators.\nAfter a brief attempt in §20 to provide motivation, in §21 I derive the Lp bound-\nedness of the Hilbert transform when p is an even integer, and in §22 I prove the\nRiesz-Thorin interpolation theory in order the extend that result to all p ∈(1, inf).\nFinally, in §23 I use Calder`on and Zygmund's method of rotations to prove Lp\nboundedness of odd Calder`on-Zygmund kernels.\nIn so far as possible, I have tried to avoid the use of unfamiliar results, but I\nam well aware that what is familiar to some may be unfamiliar to others. At a\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nminimum, the reader is expected to had a rigorous course in Lebesgue integration\ntheory. In addition, I have assumed some comfort with the ideas of elementary func-\ntional analysis, especially Hilbert spaces. Other than that, the only prerequisites\nare an interest in mathematics and a willingness to do computations.\n1. Basic Theory of Fourier Series\nSet em(x) = eı2πmx for m ∈Z and x ∈R, and observe that {em : m ∈Z} is an\northonormal family in L2(λ[0,1); C).1 Even though it involves an abuse of notation,\nwe will use (φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) to denote\nR\n[0,1) φ(y)e-m(y) dy for φ ∈L1(λ[0,1); C).\nGiven a function φ : [0, 1) -→C, define its periodic extension φ : R -→C\nby φ(x) = φx -⌊x⌋, where ⌊x⌋= max{n ∈Z : x ≥n}. Notice that if φ ∈\nL1(λ[0,1); C), then\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(x) dx =\nZ\n[a,a+1)\nφ(x) dx for all a ∈R.\nSimilarly,\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(-x) dx =\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(x) dx.\nFor bounded, continuous functions φ and ψ on [0, 1), define\nφ ∗ψ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(x -y)ψ(y) dy,\nand use the preceding to check that\nφ ∗ψ(x) =\nZ\n[-x,-x+1]\nφ(y) ψ(x -y) dy = ψ ∗φ(x).\nFinally, by the continuous version of Minkowski's inequality,2\n∥φ ∗ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C) ≤∥φ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C)∥ψ∥L1(λ[0,1);C) ∧∥ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C)∥φ∥L1(λ[0,1);C)\nfor any p ∈[1, inf).\nHence, for each p ∈[1, inf), (φ, ψ) ⇝φ ∗ψ has a unique\ncontinuous extension as a map bilinear map from L1(λ[0,1); C) × Lp(λ[0,1); C) into\nLp(λ[0,1); C), and\n(1.1)\n∥φ ∗ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C) ≤∥φ∥L1(λ[0,1);C)∥ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C)\ncontinues to hold.\nTheorem 1.1. If φ ∈Lpλ[0,1]; C for some p ∈[1, inf), then\nlim\nr↗1\nφ -\nX\nm∈Z\nr|m|φ, em\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C)em\n\nLp(λ[0,1];C)\n= 0,\nand, if φ ∈C[0, 1]; C satisfies φ(0) = φ(1), then3\nlim\nr↗1\nφ -\nX\nm∈Z\nr|m|φ, em\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C)em\n\nu\n= 0.\n1For a measure space (E, F, μ) and p ∈[1, inf], Lp(μ; C) is the associated Lebesgue space. For\na Borel measurable subset S ⊆RN, λS is the Lebesgue's measure resticted to S.\n2If φ ∈Lp(μ; C), then ∥φ∥Lp(μ;C) is its Lp-norm.\n3∥· ∥u is the uniform (i.e., supremum norm).\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nProof. Define\npr(x) =\nX\nm∈Z\nr|m|em(x) for r ∈[0, 1) and x ∈[0, 1).\nClearly\nR 1\n0 pr(x) dx = 1, pr(-x) = pr(x), and epr is continuous. In addition,\npr(x) =\n1 -re1(x)+\nre-1(x)\n1 -re-1(x) =\n1 -r2\n|1 -re1(x)|2 =\n1 -r2\n1 -2r cos 2πx + r2 for r ∈[0, 1),\nand so pr ≥0.\nObviously,\nX\nm∈Z\nr|m|φ, em\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C)em(x) = pr ∗φ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1)\npr(y) φ(x + y) dy\nsince pr is even. Now suppose that φ ∈C[0, 1] : C with φ(0) = φ(1). Then, since\nlimr↗1\nR 1\nδ pr(y) dy = 0 for each δ ∈(0, 1), it is easy to check that\nlim\nr↗1 sup\nx∈[0,1]\n\nZ 1\nφ(x + y) dy -f(x)\n≤ωφ(δ),\nwhere ωφ is the modulus of continuity of φ. Thus the second part of the theorem\nhas been proved.\nTo prove the first part, let φ ∈Lp(λ[0,1); C), and choose choose a sequence {φk :\nk ≥1} ⊆C[0, 1]; C which satisfy φk(0) = φk(1) and ∥φ -φk∥Lp(λ[0,1];C) -→0 as\nk →inf. Then, for each k,\n∥pr ∗φ -φ∥Lp(λ[0,1];C)\n≤∥pr ∗(φ -φk)∥Lp(λ[0,1];C) + ∥pr ∗φk -φk∥Lp(λ[0,1];C) + ∥φk -φ∥Lp(λ[0,1];C),\nand so, by (1.1), for all k.\nlim\nr↗1 ∥pr ∗φ -φ∥Lp(λ[0,1];C) ≤2∥φk -φ∥Lp(λ[0,1];C).\nFinally, let k →inf.\n□\nTheorem 1.2. {em : m ∈Z} is an orthonormal basis in L2(λ[0,1); C), and so, for\neach φ ∈L2(λ[0,1); C),\n(1.2)\nX\nm∈Z\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)em ≡lim\nn→inf\nX\n|m|≤n\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) = φ,\nwhere the convergence is in L2(λ[0,1); C). In addition, for all φ, ψ ∈L2(λ[0,1); C),\n(φ, ψ)L2(λ[0,1);C) =\nX\nm∈Z\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)(ψ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C).\nProof. It suffices to check the first statement, and to do so all we need to know is\nthat (φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) = 0 for all m ∈Z implies φ = 0 for a set of φ's which is dense\nin L2(λ[0,1); C). But, by Theorem 1.1, we know this for continuous φ's satisfying\nφ(0) = φ(1), and these are dense in L2(λ[0,1); C).\n□\nEquation (1.2) is known as Parseval's identity for Fourier series.\nDefine the partial sum Snφ = P\n|m|≤n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)em.\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nCorollary 1.3. If φ ∈C([0, 1]; C) and\nX\nm=0\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)\n< inf,\nthen the series\nX\nm∈Z\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)em(x)\nis uniformly absolutely convergent to φ. In fact,\nSn(φ) -φ\n\nu ≤\nX\n|m|>n\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)\n.\nProof. That the series if uniformly absolutely convergent is obvious. To see that\nit must be converging to φ, let ψ be uniform limit of {Snφ : n ≥0}. Then ψ is\ncontinuous and, because φ is the L2(λ[0,1); C) limit of this series, ψ = φ λ[0,1]-almost\neverywhere, which, since both are continues, means that they are equal everywhere.\nGiven these statements, the final estimate is trivial.\n□\nLemma 1.4. Let l≥1 and assume that φ ∈Cl([0, 1]; C) satisfies φ(k)(0) = φ(k)(1)\nfor 0 ≤k ≤l-1. Then\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) =\n\nı\n2πm\nlφ(l), em\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C) for m = 0.\nProof. Clearly it suffices that prove the result when l= 1. To do so, use integration\nby parts and the condition φ(0) = φ(1) to check that\nZ 1\nφ(y)e-m(y) dy =\n-ı2πm\nZ 1\nφ′(y)e-m(y) dy.\n□\nAs a consequence of Lemma 1.4, we see that if φ ∈C1([0, 1]; C) satisfies φ(0) =\nφ(1), then\nX\n|m|>n\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)\n≤\nX\n|m|>n\n(φ′, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)\n\n2π|m|\n≤1\n2π\n\nX\nm>n\nm-2\n! 1\n∥φ′∥L2(λ[0,1);C) ≤\n∥φ′∥L2(λ[0,1);C)\nπ(2n)\n.\nHence, by Corollary 1.3,\n∥Snφ -φ∥u ≤∥φ′∥u\nπ(2n)\n2 .\nExercise 1.1. Prove the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, which is the statement that\nlimn→inf(φ, en)L2(λ[0,1);C) = 0 for all φ ∈L1(λ[0,1); C).\nExercise 1.2. Let φ be a Lipschitz continuous function satisfying φ(0) = φ(1),\nand show that\nSnφ -φ∥u ≤∥φ∥Lip\nπ(2n)\n2 .\nHint: Introduce the functions φk = p 1\nk ∗φ.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\n2. Gibbs Phenomenon\nHere we will examine what can be said for a φ ∈C([0, 1]; C) that is not periodic.\nFor example, consider the function φ(x) = x for x ∈[0, 1]. Clearly\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) =\nı\n2πm for m = 0,\nand so\nSn(x) = 1\n2 -1\nπ\nn\nX\nm=1\nsin 2πmx\nm\n,\nwhere Sn ≡Snφ. Now set\nΦm(x) =\nm\nX\nk=1\nsin 2πkx.\nThen Φm(x) is the imaginary part of\nm\nX\nk=1\nek(x) = e1(x)1 -em(x)\n1 -e1(x) =\ne1(x) -em+1(x)1 -e-1(x)\n2(1 -cos 2πx)\n= e1(x) -1 -em+1 + em(x)\n2(1 -cos 2πx)\n,\nwhich is\nsin 2πx -sin 2π(m + 1)x + sin 2πmx\n2(1 -cos 2πx)\n.\nAfter using some of trigonometric identities, one sees that\n(2.1)\nΦm(x) = cos πx sin2 πmx\nsin πx\n+ sin πmx cos πmx.\nIn particular, |Φm(x)| ≤3 1\nx ∨\n1-x\n.\nSumming by parts, one sees that\nSn(x) = 1\n2 -Φn(x)\nπn\n-\nn-1\nX\nm=1\nΦm(x)\nπm(m + 1),\nwhich means that\n(2.2)\nSn(x) -x\n≤ 1\nx ∨\n1-x\nπn.\nIn particular, Sn(x) is converging to x uniformly on compact subsets of (0, 1).\nTo see what happens for x near to 0, consider x =\nk\n2n for k ≥1, and observe\nthat\nn\nX\nm=1\nsin πkm\nn\nm\n= 1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nsin πkm\nn\nm\nn\n-→\nZ\n[0,1]\nsin πkx\nx\ndx -→\nZ\n[0,πk]\nsin x\nx\ndx.\nHence, since (cf. (7.11) in §7)\nlim\nR→inf\nZ\n[0,R]\nsin x\nx\ndx = π\n2 ,\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nSn\nk\n2n\n= -1\nπ lim\nR→inf\nZ\n[πk,R]\nsin x\nx\ndx\n= (-1)k+1\nπ2k\n-1\nπ\nZ\n[πk,inf)\ncos x\nx2\ndx = (-1)k+1\nπ2k\n+ 2\nπ\nZ\n[πk,inf)\nsin x\nx3\ndx\nas n →inf. Therefore\nSn\nk\n2n\n= (-1)k+1\nπ2k\n\n1 -ak\nπk\n\n+ εn(k),\nwhere\nak = (-1)k2(πk)2\nZ inf\nπk\nsin x\nx3\ndx ∈(-1, 1)\nand limn→infεn(k) = 0. This shows that, for large n, Sn\nk\n2n\nis at least\n2π2k if k is\nodd and at most -\n2π2k if k is even. This sort of oscillatory behavior is known as\nGibbs's phenomenon, although Gibbs seems not to have been the first to discover\nit.\nExercise 2.1.

Define {bl: l≥0} ⊆R inductively by\nb0 = 1 and bl+1 =\nl\nX\nk=0\n(-1)kbl-k\n(k + 2)! ,\nand set\n(3.1)\nBl(x) =\nl\nX\nk=0\n(-1)kbl-k\nk!\nxk for l≥0.\nThen {Bl: l≥0} are the one and only functions satisfying\n(3.2)\nB0 = 1, B′\nl+1 = -Blfor l≥0, and Bl(1) = Bl(0) for l≥2.\nProof. To see that there is at most one set of functions satisfying (3.2), let {Dl:\nl≥0} be the set of differences between two solutions, and set l= inf{l: Dl= 0}.\nThen l≥1, and, if l< inf, then Dlis a constant a and there is a b ∈R such that\nDl+1(x) = -ax + b. But -a + b = Dl+1(1) = Dl+1(0) = b, and therefore a = 0.\nSince this would mean that Dl= -D′\nl+1 = 0, no such lcan exist.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nBy definition, B0 = 1, and it is easy to check that B′\nl+1 = -Bl. To verify the\nperiodicity property, note that\nBl+2(1) -Bl+2(0) =\nl+2\nX\nk=1\n(-1)kbl+2-k\nk!\n= -bl+1 +\nl+2\nX\nk=2\n(-1)kbl+2-k\nk!\n= -bl+1 +\nl\nX\nk=0\n(-1)kbl-k\n(k + 2)!\n= 0.\n□\nThe functions {Bl: l≥0} in (3.1) are known as Bernoulli polynomials.\nTheorem 3.2. For l≥2 and x ∈[0, 1],\n(3.3)\nBl(x) = -ıl\n(2π)l\nX\nn=0\nen(x)\nnl\n.\nIn particular, b2l+1 = 0 and\n(3.4)\nζ(2l) ≡\ninf\nX\nm=1\nm2l= (-1)l+122l-1π2lb2l\nfor l≥1.\nProof. First observe that, for l≥1,\nBl, e0\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) = -\nZ 1\nB′\nl+1(x) dx = Bl+1(0) -Bl+1(1) = 0\nand, for l≥2 and n = 0,\nBl, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\nı\n2πn\nBl-1, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C)\nand therefore\nA2πn\nı\nal-1 Bl, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) = B1, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\nZ 1\n2 -xe-n(x) dx = -ı\n2πn.\nHence\nBl, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\n-ıl\n(2πn)l\nfor l≥2 and n = 0, which completes the proof of (3.3). Finally, because bl= Bl(0),\nit is clear from (3.3) that b2l+1 = 0 and that (3.4) holds.\n□\nBesides (3.4), the Bernoulli polynomials play a critical role in what is known as\nthe Euler-Maclauren formula:\n(3.5)\nZ n\nf(x) dx -\nn\nX\nm=1\nf(m)\n= -\nl\nX\nk=1\nbk\nf (k-1)(n) -f k-1(0) +\nZ n\nBl(x)f (l)(x) dx\nfor l≥1,\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nwhere Blis the periodic extension of Bl↾[0, 1) to R. To prove (3.5), first note that\nZ n\nf(x) dx -\nn\nX\nm=1\nf(m) =\nn\nX\nm=1\nZ m\nm-1\nf(x) -f(m) dx\n= -\nn\nX\nm=1\nZ m\nm-1\nx -(m -1)f ′(x) dx\n=\nn\nX\nm=1\nA\n-b1\nf(m) -f(m -1) +\nZ m\nm-1\nB1\nx -(m -1)f ′(x) dx\na\n= -b1\nf(n) -f(0) +\nZ n\nB1(x)f ′(x) dx.\nHence, (3.5) holds when l= 1. Next observe that for any l≥1,\nZ n\nBl(x) = n\nZ 1\nBl(x) dx = nBl+1(1) -Bl+1(0) = 0,\nand therefore\nZ n\nBl(x)f (l)(x) dx =\nn\nX\nm=1\nZ m\nm-1\nBl\nx -(m -1)f (l)(x) -f (l)(m) dx\n=\nn\nX\nm=1\nA\n-bl+1\nf (l)(m) -f (l)(m -1) +\nZ m\nm-1\nBl+1\nx -(m -1)f (l+1)(x) dx\na\n= -bl+1\nf (l)(n) -f(0) +\nZ n\nBl+1(x)f (l+1)(x) dx.\nTherefore, (3.5) for limplies (3.5) for l+ 1.\nTheorem 3.3.

Comparing Summability Methods\nIn preparation for the following section, we will review here basic definitions and\nresults for different notions of convergence of a series.\nGiven a sequence {am : m ≥1} ⊆C, set\nSn =\nn\nX\nm=1\nam and An = 1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nSm,\nand when limn→inf|am|\nm ≤1, set\nA(r) =\ninf\nX\nm=1\namrm-1 for r ∈[0, 1).\nThe Sn's are called the partial sums of the corresponding series, the An's are its\nC esaro means, and r ⇝A(r) is its Abel function. The series is said to be summable\nto s ∈C if s = limn→infSn, it is C esaro summable to s ∈C if limn→infAn = s, and\nit is Abel summable to s ∈C if s = limr↗1 A(r)\nHere we will show that\nsummable to s =⇒C esaro summable to s =⇒\nlim\nm→inf\nam\nm = 0 and Abel summable to s.\nThe Exercise 4.1 below outlines a proof that neither implication can be reversed.\nThe first implication is trivial. To prove the second, assume C esaro summability,\nand note that\nan\nn = An -An-1 + An-1\nn\n-→0.\nNext, write\nam =\n\nA1\nif m = 1\n2A2 -A1\nif m = 2\nmAm -2(m -1)Am-1 + (m -2)Am-2\nif m ≥3,\nand therefore\nA(r) =\ninf\nX\nm=1\nmrm-1Am -2\ninf\nX\nm=2\n(m -1)rm-1Am-1 +\ninf\nX\nm=3\n(m -2)rm-1Am-2\n=\ninf\nX\nm=1\n(rm-1 -2rm + rm+1)mAm = (1 -r)2\ninf\nX\nm=1\nmrm-1Am.\nNow observe that\nn\nX\nm=1\nmrm-1 = ∂r\nn\nX\nm=0\nrm = ∂r\n1 -rn\n1 -r = 1 -rn -n(1 -r)rn-1\n(1 -r)2\n.\nHence,\n(1 -r)2\nn\nX\nmrm-1 ≤1 -rn and (1 -r)2\ninf\nX\nmrm-1 = 1.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nAssume that An -→s, and, given ε > 0, choose n so that |Am -s| ≤ε for m > n.\nThen\nA(r) -s\n= (1 -r)2\n\ninf\nX\nm=1\nmrm-1(Am -s)\n≤(1 -r)2\nn\nX\nm=1\nmrm-1|Am -s| + ε\n≤(1 -rn) max\n1≤m≤n |Am -s| + ε,\nand therefore limr↗1 |A(r) -s| ≤ε.\nExercise 4.1. Show that\n(i) the series for {(-1)m-1 : m ≥1} is C esaro summable to 1\n2 but not summable,\n(ii) the series for {(-1)m-1m : m ≥1} is Abel summable to 1\n4 but not C esaro\nsummable. In fact, show that A2n = 0 and A2n+1 =\nn+1\n2n+1 -→1\n2.\n5. Some Refinements\nIn this section we will apply the notions of summability discussed in the previous\nsection to Fourier series. Observe that we have already considered Abel summability\nin §1.\nTo examine further when the series is summable, introduce the function\nDn(x) =\nX\n|m|≤n\nem(x) for x ∈R.\nThen Dn, which is often called the Dirichlet kernel, is an even, periodic function\nwith period 1,\nR 1\n0 Dn(x) dx = 1, and Snφ = Dn ∗φ. In addition\nDn(x) = e-n(x)\n2n\nX\nm=0\nem(x) = e-n(x)1 -e2n+1(x)\n1 -e1(x)\n= e-ıπ(2n+1)x -eıπ(2n+1)x\ne-ıπx -eıπx\n= sin π(2n + 1)x\nsin πx\n.\nHence,\nSnφ(x) -φ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1]\nφ(x + y) -φ(x)\nsin πy\nsin π(2n + 1)y dy.\nNow suppose that φ is an R-valued function for which φ(0) = φ(1), and assume\nthat φ ∈Cα[0, 1]; C) 4 is H older continuous of order α ∈(0, 1). Set\nψ(y) = eıπy φ(x + y) -φ(x)\nsin πy\n.\nThen ψ ∈L1(λ[0,1); C) and Snφ(x) -φ(x) is the imaginary part of\nZ\n[0,1]\nψ(y)e-2n+1(y) dt = ψ, e2n-1\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C),\nand so, by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma (cf. Exercise 1.1), Snφ(x) -→φ(x) as\nn →inf. The preceding shows that if φ ∈Cα[0, 1]; C satisfies φ(0) = φ(1), then\nSnφ -→φ pointwise, but it does not provide a rate of convergence or even say if\nthe convergence is uniform.\n4Cα(E; C) space of C-valued functions on a metric space E which are uniformly H older con-\ntinuous of order α ∈(0, 1).\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nC esaro summability of Fourier series was initiated by Fej er. Obviously,\nn\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nSmφ = Fn ∗φ,\nwhere\nFn(x) ≡1\nn\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nDn(x).\nThe function Fn is called the Fej er kernel, and it is clear that Fn is a continuous,\neven function of period 1 for which\nR\n[0,1] Fn(x) dx = 1. In addition, nFn(x) sin πx\nis the imaginary part of\neıπx\nn-1\nX\nm=0\ne2m(x) = eıπx 1 -eıπ2nx\n1 -eı2πx = ı(1 -eı2πnx)\n2 sin πx\n,\nand so\n(5.1)\nFn(x) = 1 -cos 2πnx\n2n sin2 πx\n= 1\nn\nAsin πnx\nsin πx\na2\n.\nProceeding as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, one sees that\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1]\nFn(y) φ(x + y) -φ(x) dx -→0\nuniformly if φ is continuous and satisfies φ(1) = φ(0). Equivalently,\nlim\nn→inf\n\nn\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nSmφ -φ\n\nu\n= 0.\nIt turns out that one can do much better.\nTheorem 5.1. Let φ : [-1\n2, 1\n2] -→C be a measurable function, let x ∈-1\n2, 1\n, and\nassume that there is a C ∈(0, inf) and α ∈(0, 1] such that | φ(x+y)-φ(x)| ≤C|y|α\nfor y ∈-1\n2, 1\n. For n ≥5\n(5.2)\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤C\n(\n(1+α)nα + 4(n1-α-41-α)\nπ2(1-α)n\n+ 1-2-(1+α)\n2α(1+α)n\nif α ∈(0, 1)\n16n +\n4 log n\nπ2n(1-α)\nif α = 1.\nHence\nlim\nn→infnα|Fn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤\n1 + α +\nπ2(1 -α)\nif α ∈(0, 1)\nand\nlim\nn→inf\nn\nlog n|Fn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤4\nπ2\nif α = 1.\nProof. Without loss in generality, I will assume that C = 1.\nThe proof turns on the estimates\n(5.3)\nFn(y) ≤\n\nn\nfor all y ∈-1\n2, 1\n\nπ2ny2\nwhen |y| ∈0, 1\n\nn\nwhen |y| ∈ 1\n4, 1\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nThat Fn(y) ≤n is clear from the fact that ∥Dm∥u ≤1 and therefore that nFn(y) ≤\n2 Pn-1\nm=1 m + n = n2.\nTo see second inequality, note that cos πt ≥2-1\n2 when\n|y| ∈0, 1\nand therefore that\n| sin πy| =\nZ π|y|\ncos t dt ≥2-1\n2 π|y|.\nAs for Fn(y) ≤2\nn when |y| ∈ 1\n4, 1\n, simply remember that | sin πy| ≥2-1\n2 for such\ny's.\nAssume that α ∈(0, 1). Because\nR 1\n-1\n2 Fn(y) = 1\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤\nZ\n-1\nFn(y)\nφ(x + y) -φ(x)\ndy\n≤n\nZ\nn\n|y|α dy +\nπ2n\nZ\nn\n|y|α-2 dy + 2\nn\nZ\n4 ≤|y|≤1\n|y|α dy\n≤\n(1 + α)nα + 4(n1-α -41-α)\nπ2(1 -α)n\n+ 1 -2-(1+α)\n2α(1 + α)n .\nIf α = 1, the top line in (5.2) holds for all α ∈(0, 1), and therefore one need\nonly examine what happens as α ↗1. Clearly\n(1+α)nα ↘1\nn and 1-2-(1+α)\n2α(1+α)n ↘\n16n\nas α ↗1. To handle the remaining term, note that it can be written as\n42-α\nπ2n\nn\n1-α -1\n1 -α\nwhich decreases to 4 log n\nπ2n\nas α ↗1.\n□\nOne could of course have derived the estimate when α = 1 directly by the same\nargument as was used when α < 1. However, the derivation given has the advantage\nthat it shows the estimates get stronger for all n ≥5, not just asymptotically, as α\nincreases.\nObviously, results like those in Theorem 5.1 turn on the continuity properties of\nφ, properties that a generic element of L1(λ[0,1); C) will not possess. Nonetheless,\nLebesgue showed that every locally λR-integrable φ does have a continuity property\nat almost everywhere point. Namely, he showed that\nlim\nr↘0\nr\nZ r\n| φ(x ± t) -φ(x)| dt = 0\nfor λR-almost every x ∈R,\nand he used this fact to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.2. If φ ∈ L1λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C, then\nlim\nn→infFn ∗φ(x) = φ(x) for λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]-almost every x ∈[0, 1].\nProof. Set φx(y) = | φ(x + y) -φ(x)| and\nΦx(y) = 1\n|y|\nZ |y|\nφx(sgn(y)t) dt.\nBy Lebesgue's theorem, lim|y|↘0 Φx(y) = 0 for λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]-almost every x ∈-1\n2, 1\n.\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nLet x be such a point. Then\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤\nZ 0\n-1\nFn(y)φx(y) dy +\nZ\nFn(y)φx(y) dy.\nWe will show only that limn→inf\nR 1\n0 Fn(y)φx(y) dy = 0 because the proof that\nlimn→inf\nR 0\n-1\n2 Fn(y)φx(y) dy = 0 is essentially the same.\nUsing our estimates for Fn in (5.3), one has\nZ\nFn(y)φx(y) dy =\nZ\nn\nFn(y)φx(y) dy +\nZ\nn\nFn(y)φx(y) dy\n≤n\nZ\nn\nφx(y) dy + 2\nn\nZ\nn\nφx(y)\ny2\ndy.\nSince\nn\nZ\nn\nφx(y) dy = Φx\nn\n,\nthe first term tends to 0. As for the second, use integration by parts to see that it\nis dominated by\n4Φx\n\nn\n+ 4\nn\nZ\nn\nΦx(y)\ny2\ndy.\nFinally, given ε > 0, choose δ ∈0, 1\nso that Φx(y) ≤ε for 0 ≤y ≤δ. Then, for\nn > 1\nδ ,\nn\nZ\nn\nΦx(y)\ny2\ndy ≤ε\nn\nZ δ\nn\ny2 dy + 1\nn\nZ\nδ\nΦx(y)\ny2\ndy ≤2ε + ∥Φx∥u\nδn\n,\nand so\nlim\nn→inf\nZ\nFn(y)φx(y) dy ≤4ε.\n□\nTheorem 5.2 is a stark contrast to a famous example produced in 1926 by Kol-\nmogorov5 of a function in L1λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C for which {Snφ(x) : n ≥0} diverges\nat every x. It is also interesting to compare it to more recent results by L. Car-\nleson and R. Hunt.\nNamely, Carleson showed that Snφ -→φ (a.e.,λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]) if\nφ ∈L2λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C, and Hunt showed that the same is true for φ ∈Lpλ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C\nfor p ∈(1, inf).\nExercise 5.1. Show that\nlim\nn→inf\nnα\nZ\n-1\nFn(y)|y|α dy > 0 for α ∈(0, 1)\nand that\nlim\nn→inf\nn\nlog n\nZ\n-1\nFn(y)|y| dy > 0.\n5A.N.

The L1 Fourier Transform\nBy an easy rescaling argument, one knows that, for any L ∈Z+ and f ∈\nC1([-L, L]; C) satisfying f(-L) = f(L),\nf(x) = 1\n2L\nX\nm∈Z\nZ L\n-L\neı 2πm(y-x)\n2L\nf(y) dy = lim\nR→inf\nZ L\n-L\nN\n2L\nX\n|m|≤R\neı 2πm(y-x)\n2L\ne\nf(y) dx.\nNow suppose that f ∈C1\nc (R; C). Then\nf(x) = lim\nL→inflim\nR→inf\nZ L\n-L\nN\n2L\nX\n|m|≤R\neı 2πm(y-x)\n2L\ne\nf(y) dy.\nThus, if one can justify reversing the order in which the limits are taken, one would\nhave that\nf(x) = lim\nR→inf\nZ CZ R\n-R\neıξ2π(x-y) dξ\na\nf(y) dy\n= lim\nR→inf\n2π\nZ 2πR\n-2πR\ne-ıξx\nAZ\neıξyf(y) dy\na\ndξ.\nIn other words, there is reason to hope that, under suitable conditions on f,\n(6.1)\nf(x) = 1\n2π\nZ\ne-ıξx ˆf(ξ) dξ where ˆf(ξ) ≡\nZ\neıξyf(y) dy.\nThe function ˆf is called the Fourier transform of f, and our primary goal here\nwill be to find out in what sense (6.1) is true, first when f ∈L1(λR; C) and then\nwhen f ∈L2(λR; C). However, we will begin with some computations involving ˆf\nthat don't require our knowing when (6.1) holds.\n7. Computations and Applications of L1 Fourier Transforms\nIf f ∈L1(λR; C), then it is clear that ˆf is continuous and that\n(7.1)\n∥ˆf∥u ≤∥f∥L1(λR;C).\nLemma 7.1. If f ∈C1(R, C) ∩L1(λR; C) and f ′ ∈L1(λR; C), then\n(7.2)\n\"\nf ′(ξ) = -ıξ ˆf(ξ).\nProof. If f has compact support, then (7.2) is an easy application of integration by\nparts. To prove it under the given conditions, choose a function η ∈CinfR; [0, 1]\nfor which η(y) = 1 when y ∈[-1, 1] and η(y) = 0 when y /∈[-2, 2], and set\nfn(y) = η y\nn\nf(y). Then fn -→f and f ′\nn -→f ′ in L1(λR; C) and so\n\"\nf ′(ξ) = lim\nn→inf\nc\nf ′n(ξ) = -ıξ lim\nn→inf\nc\nfn(ξ) = -ıξ ˆf(ξ).\n□\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nAs a consequence of Lemma 7.1, it is easy to prove the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma\nin this context. Namely, (7.2) makes it clear for compactly support f ∈C1(R; C),\nand (7.1) makes it clear that the set of f's for which it is holds is closed in L1(λR; C).\nWe next turn to the computation of ˆf in two important cases.\nSet gt(x) = (2πt)-1\n2 e-x2\nfor (t, x) ∈(0, inf) × R, and check that ∂tgt(x) =\n2∂2\nxgt(x). Hence, for any ζ ∈C, integration by parts leads to\n∂t\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx = 1\nZ\neζx∂2\nxgt(x) dx = ζ2\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx.\nSince\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx =\nZ\net\n2 ζxg1(x) dx -→1\nas t ↘0,\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx = e\ntζ2\n2 .\nIn particular\n(7.3)\n\"\ngt(ξ) = e-ξ2\nEquivalently, \"\ngt = 2π\nt\n2 g 1\nt and so\n(7.4)\nbgt)∧= 2πgt.\nSet py(x) = 1\nπ\ny\nx2+y2 for (y, x) ∈(0, inf) × R, and note that\nZ\npy(x) dx =\nZ\np1(x) dx = 1 for all y > 0.\nIn addition, because py(x) is the real part of\nı\nπz with z = x + ıy, (x, y) ⇝py(x) is\nharmonic. Thus, ∂2\nxpy = -∂2\nypy, and so, by (7.2),\n∂2\ny \"\npy(ξ) = ξ2 \"\npy(ξ).\nThus, for each ξ,\n'\npy(ξ) = a(ξ)eyξ + b(ξ)e-yξ,\nwhere, since \"\npy(0) = 1, a(ξ) + b(ξ) = 1. Because |'\npy(ξ)| ≤1, ξ ≥0 =⇒a(ξ) =\n0 & b(ξ) = 1 and ξ < 0 =⇒a(ξ) = 1 & b(ξ) = 0. Hence\n(7.5)\n\"\npy(ξ) = e-y|ξ|.\nHere is an interesting application of equations (7.3) and (7.5). Since\nξ2 + y2 =\nZ inf\ne-t(ξ2+y2) dx =\nZ inf\ne-ty2\"\ng2t(ξ) dt\nand \"\ng2t\n∧= 2πg2t,\nπ\ny e-y|x| = 2π\nZ inf\ne-ty2g2t(x) dt = π\nZ inf\nt-1\n2 e-ty2e-x2\n4t dt.\nThus, for x, y ∈(0, inf),\n(7.6)\nZ inf\nt-1\n2 e-ty2e-x2\nt dt = π\n2 e-2yx\ny\n,\na computation which can also be done using a somewhat tricky change of variables.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nTheorem 7.2. (Poisson Sum) Let f ∈L1(λR; C) ∩C(R; C), and assume that\nX\nn∈Z\nC\nsup\nx∈[0,1]\n|f(x + n)| + | ˆf(2πn)|\na\n< inf.\nThen\n(7.7)\nX\nn∈Z\nf(n) =\nX\nn∈Z\nˆf(2πn).\nProof. Define f(x) = P\nn∈Z f(x + n). Then f is a continuous periodic function\nwith period 1, and\nf, em\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\nX\nn∈Z\nZ 1\ne-ı2πmxf(x + n) dx =\nZ\ne-ı2πmxf(x) dx = ˆf(-2πm).\nThus, P\nm∈Z\n( f, em)L2(λ[0,1];C)\n< inf, and therefore\nf(x) =\nX\nm∈Z\nˆf(-2πm)em(x) =\nX\nm∈Z\nˆf(2πm)e-m(x),\nwhere the convergence of the series is absolute and uniform. By taking x = 0, (7.7)\nfollows.\n□\nEquation (7.7) is known as the Poisson summation formula. Among its many\napplications is the following.\nWhen f = py, (7.7) says that\ny\nπ\nX\nn∈Z\ny2 + n2 =\nX\nn∈Z\ne-2πy|n| = 1 + e-2πy\n1 -e-2πy = coth πy,\nand so\n(7.8)\nX\nn∈Z\ny2 + n2 = π coth πy\ny\nfor y > 0.\nA famous application of (7.8) is Euler's product formula:\n(7.9)\nsin πx = πx\ninf\nY\nm=1\nA\n1 -x2\nm2\na\n.\nTo prove it, first observe that\nx2 + m2 = 1\n2x∂x logx2 + m2 = 1\n2x∂x log\nA\n1 + x2\nm2\na\nfor m = 0\nand that π coth πy = ∂y log(sinh πy). Hence, by (7.8)\nx∂x log\ninf\nY\nn=1\nA\n1 + x2\nn2\na\n+ 1\nx2 = 1\nx∂x log(sinh πx),\nwhich means that\n∂x log\ninf\nY\nn=1\nA\n1 + x2\nn2\na\n= ∂x log(x-1 sinh πx).\n\nDANIEL W.

To this end, note that\ngR(ξ, y) = 2\nZ R\nx sin ξx\nx2 + y2 dx = 2\nξ\nC\n-R cos ξR\nR2 + y2 + 2\nZ R\n(y2 -x2) cos ξx\n(x2 + y2)2\ndx\na\n-→4\nξ\nZ inf\n(y2 -x2) cos ξx\n(x2 + y2)2\ndx\nuniformly for ξ in compacts subsets of (0, inf).\nThe final step is the identify g(ξ, y) as πe-yξ. For this purpose, observe that\ngR(ξ, y) = -ı\nZ R\n-R\nxeıξx\nx2 + y2 dx = ∂ξfR(ξ, y)\nwhere\nfR(ξ, y) = -π\ny\nZ R\n-R\npy(x)eıξx dx -→-π\ny e-yξ.\n6The most commonly given proof is based on contour integration and Cauchy's theorem.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nHence\nfR(η) -fR(ξ) =\nZ η\nξ\ngR(t, y) dt,\nand therefore\nπ\ny\ne-yξ -e-yη =\nZ η\nξ\ng(t, y) dt,\nfrom which g(ξ, y) = πe-yξ follows easily.\nExercise 7.1.

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Semigroup\nSet gt(x) = (2πt)-1\n2 e-x2\n2t , and note that\n(9.1)\nZ\ngs(x -ξ)gt(ξ -y) dξ = gs+t(y -x) and ∂tgt(x) = 1\n2∂2\nxgt(x).\nFor (t, x, y) ∈(0, inf) × R × R, define\n(9.2)\np(t, x, y) = g1-e-ty -e-t\n2 x\n= 2π(1 -e-t)-1\n2 exp\nC\n-(y -e-t\n2 x)2\n2(1 -e-t)\na\n= e\nt\n2 get-1\nx -e\nt\n2 y.\nFrom the first part of (9.1) and the third equality in (9.2), we see that\nZ\np(s, x, ξ)p(t, ξ, y) dξ = e\nt\nZ\ng1-e-sξ -e-s\n2 yget-1\nξ -e\nt\n2 x dξ\n= e\nt\n2 get-e-se\nt\n2 y -e-s\n2 x = p(s + t, x, y).\nHence p(t, x, y) satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\n(9.3)\np(s + t, x, y) =\nZ\np(s, x, ξ)p(t, ξ, y) dξ.\nIn addition, using the second part of (9.1), one sees that\n(9.4)\n∂tp(t, x, y) = Lxp(t, x, y) where Lx = 1\n∂2\nx -x∂x\n.\nNext define\n(9.5)\nPtφ(x) =\nZ\nφ(y)p(t, x, y) dy\nfor φ ∈C(R; C) with at most exponential growth at inf, and use (9.3) to see that\n{Pt : t > 0} is a semigroup (i.e., Ps+t = Ps *Pt). In addition, use (9.4) to show\nthat\n(9.6)\n∂tPtφ = LPtφ.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nAfter making the change of variable y →e\nt\n2 y, one sees that another expression for\nPtφ is\n(9.7)\nPtφ(x) =\nZ\nφe-t\n2 yget-1(y -x dy =\nZ\ng1(y)φ(1 -e-t)\n2 y + x dy,\nfrom which it is easy to see that Ptφ -→φ uniformly on compact subsets as t ↘0.\nFurther, if p ∈[1, inf), then, by Minkowski's inequality,\n∥Ptf∥Lp(λR;C) ≤\nZ\ng1(y)\nAZ f(1 -e-t)\n2 y + xp dx\na 1\np\ndy = ∥f∥Lp(λR;C),\nand, as t ↘0,\n∥Ptf -f∥Lp(λR;C) ≤\nZ\ng1(y)\nAZ f(1 -e-t)\n2 y + x -f(x)\np dy\na 1\np\ndx -→0\nsince\n2∥f∥Lp(λR;C) ≥\nAZ f(1 -e-t)\n2 y + x -f(x)\np dx\na 1\np\n-→0.\nTherefore we know that\n(9.8)\n∥Ptf∥Lp(λR;C) ≤∥f∥Lp(λR;C) and lim\nt↘0 ∥Ptf -f∥Lp(λR;C) = 0.\nIn particular, we have now shown that {Pt : t > 0} is a continuous contraction\nsemigroup, known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, on Lp(λR; C) for each\np ∈[1, inf).\nAlthough {Pt : t > 0} is a continuous semigroup on the Lebesgue spaces\nLp(λR; C), these are not the Lebesgue spaces on which it acts most naturally. In-\nstead, one should consider its action on the spaces Lp(γ; C), where γ is the standard\nGauss measure γ(dx) = (2π)-1\n2 e-x2\n2 λR(dx). The reason why is that\ne-x2\n2 p(t, x, y) = p(t, y, x)e-y2\n2 ,\nwhich means that\n(9.9)\nφ, Ptψ\nL2(γ;C) = Ptφ, ψ\nL2(γ;C).\nHence, since Pt1 = 1, Z\nPtφ dγ = φ, Pt1\nL2(γ;C) =\nZ\nφ dγ.\nAt the same time, by Jensen's inequality, |Ptφ|p ≤Pt|φ|P , and so,\nZ\n|Ptφ|p dγ ≤\nZ\nPt|φ|p dγ =\nZ\n|φ|p dγ.\nThus,\n(9.10)\n∥Ptφ∥Lp(γ;C) ≤∥φ∥Lp(γ;C) for all p ∈[1, inf).\nIn addition, if φ ∈Cb(R; C), then ∥Ptφ∥u ≤∥φ∥u and Ptφ -→φ pointwise as\nt ↘0, and therefore, for each p ∈[1, inf), ∥Ptφ -φ∥Lp(γ;C) -→0 as t ↘0. Finally,\nif φ ∈Lp(R; C), then there exists a sequence {φn : n ≥1} ⊆Cb(R; C) such that\nlimn→inf∥fn -f∥Lp(γ;C) = 0, and\n∥Ptφ -φ∥Lp(γ;C) ≤∥Pt(φ -φn)∥Lp(γ;C) + ∥Ptφn -φn∥Lp(γ;C) + ∥φn -φ∥Lp(γ;C)\n≤2∥φn -φ∥Lp(γ;C) + ∥Ptφn -φn∥Lp(γ;C).\n\nDANIEL W.

Hermite Polynomials\nDefine Hn(x) = (-1)ne\ns2\n2 ∂n\nxe-x2\n2 . Then Hn is an nth order monic polynomial\nknown as the nth Hermite polynomial.

All that we need to show is that if φ ∈L2(γ; C) and (φ, Hm)L2(γ;C) = 0 for\nall m ≥0, then φ = 0.

The Fourier Transform for L2(λR; C)\nThe basic goal here is to extend the Fourier transform on L1(R; C) ∩L2(λR; C)\nas a bounded operation on L2(λR; C) into L2(λR; C).

In addition, it is closed under\n7There are many books in which Schwartz's theory is presented, but his own original treatment\nin Th eorie des distributions, I published in 1950 by Hermann, Paris remains one of the best\naccounts.\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\ndifferentiation as well as products with smooth functions which, together with all\ntheir derivatives, have at most polynomial growth (i.e., grow no faster than some\npower of (1 + x2)). Thus the Hermite functions are all in S (R; C). Finally, since,\nfor φ ∈S (R; C),\nZ\n|φ(x)|p dx ≤∥(1 + x2)φ∥p\nu\nZ\n(1 + x2)-p dx,\nS (R; C) ⊆T\np∈[1,inf] Lp(λR; C).\nThere is an obvious notion of convergence for sequences in S (R; C). Namely,\ndefine the norms\n∥φ∥(k,l)\nu\n= ∥xk∂lφ∥u\nfor k, l∈N, and say that φj -→φ in S (R; C) if limn→inf∥φj -φ∥(k,l)\nu\n= 0 for all\nk, l∈N. The corresponding topology is the one for which G is open if and only if\nfor each φ ∈G there an m ∈N and r > 0 such that\nψ : ∥ψ -φ∥(m)\nu\n< r ⊆G,\nwhere\n∥· ∥(m)\nu\n≡max\nk,l∈N\nk+l≤m\n∥· ∥(j,l)\nu\n.\nWe will now develop a more convenient description of the topology on S (R; C),\none that shows that S (R; C) shares many properties with Hilbert spaces. Define\nthe operator H on S (R; C) into itself by\nHφ = x2φ -∂2φ.\nSince (cf. (11.1)) H = (2a+a-+ 1),\n(13.1)\nH hk = μk hk\nwhere μk = 2k + 1,\nand so we can define operators Hs for any s ∈R by\nHsφ =\ninf\nX\nm=0\nμs\nm(φ, hm)L2(λR;C) hm.\nFor each m ≥0, set\nS (m)(R; C) =\n(\nφ ∈L2(λR; C) :\ninf\nX\nk=1\nμm\nk\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)\n2 < inf\n)\n,\nand define\n(φ, ψ)S (m)(R;C) =\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμm\nk (φ, hk)L2(λR;C)( hk, ψ)L2(λR;C) = φ, Hmψ\nL2(λR;C)\n∥φ∥S (m)(R;C) = (φ, φ)\nS (m)(R;C) = φ, Hmφ 1\n2 .\nClearly S (m)(R; C) is a vector space for which (φ, ψ)S (m)(R;C) is an inner prod-\nuct. Below we will show below that it is a separable Hilbert space.\nLemma 13.1. For each m ≥0,\n∥xφ∥S (m)(R;C) ∨∥∂φ∥S (m)(R;C) ≤3m∥φ∥S (m+1)(R;C).\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nProof.

For each m ∈N, S (R; C) is a dense subset of S (m)(R; C). In\naddition, for each m ≥0, there exists a Km ∈(0, inf) such that\n(13.2)\n∥φ∥S (m)(R;C) ≤Km∥φ∥(m+1)\nu\nand\n(13.3)\n∥φ∥(m)\nu\n≤Km∥φ∥S (m+3)(R;C).\nfor all φ ∈S (R; C). Thus φn -→φ in S (R; C) if and only if\nlim\nn→inf∥φn -φ∥S (m)(R;C) = 0\nfor all m ∈N. In particular, for each φ ∈S (R; C),\nn\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C) hk -→φ in S (R; C) as n →inf.\nProof. Since H ↾S (R; C) is a symmetric operator, (13.1) implies that\nμm\nk (φ, hk)L2(λR;C) = (φ, Hm hk)L2(λR;C) = (Hmφ, hk)L2(λR;C),\nfor all φ ∈S (R; C) and m ≥0, from which it is clear that S (R; C) ⊆S (m)(R; C)\nfor all m ≥0. Moreover, since, for each φ ∈S (m)(R; C),\nS (R; C) ∋\nn\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C) hk -→φ in S (m)(R; C) as n →inf,\nS (R; C) is dense in S (m)(R; C).\nNext observe that there exist constants c(m)\nj,l∈R such that\nx2 -∂2mφ =\nX\nk,l∈N\nk+l≤2m\nc(m)\nj.lxk∂lφ,\nand use integration by parts to see that\nφ, xk∂lφ\nL2(λR;C) = (-1)l′∂l′(xk′φ), xk-k′∂l-l′φ\nL2(λR;C),\n\nDANIEL W.

To prove\n(∗), use the estimate in (11.2) to see that\n∥φ∥u ≤\ninf\nX\nk=0\n|(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)|∥ hk∥u\n≤\ninf\nX\nk=0\n(k + 1)\n2 |(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)| =\ninf\nX\nk=0\nAk + 1\nμ3\nk\na 1\nμ\nk |(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)|\n≤\ninf\nX\nk=0\nk + 1\nμ3\nk\n! 1\n2 inf\nX\nk=0\nμ3\nk|(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)|2\n! 1\n= K∥φ∥S (3)(R;C).\nwhere K =\nPinf\nk=0\nk+1\nμ3\nk\n2 .\n□\nAs a consequence of Theorem 13.2, we know that\nρS (φ, ψ) ≡\ninf\nX\nm=0\n2m+1\n∥φ -ψ∥S (m)(R;C)\n1 + ∥φ -ψ∥S (m)(R;C)\nis a metric for the topology on S (R; C). In addition, S (R; C) = Tinf\nm=0 S (m)(R; C),\nand so we can learn about properties of S (R; C) by understanding those of the\nS (m)(R; C)'s.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nFor each m ≥0, let s(m)(N; C) be the space of functions s : N -→C such that\n∥s∥s(m)(N;C) ≡\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμm\nk |s(k)|2\n! 1\n< inf,\nand define\n(s, t)s(m)(N;C) =\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμm\nk s(k)t(k) for s, t ∈s(m)(N; C),\nClearly each s(m)(N; C) is a vector space with inner product (s, t)s(m)(N;C). Finally,\nset s(N; C) = Tinf\nm=0 s(m)(N; C), and turn s(N; C) into a metric space with metric\nρs(s, t) ≡\ninf\nX\nm=0\n2m+1\n∥t -s∥s(m)(N;C)\n1 + ∥t -s∥s(m)(N;C)\n.\nThe following corollary is essentially a reformulation of the results in Theorem\n13.2. It is the analogue for S (R; C) of the fact that every separable Hilbert space\nis isomorphic to l2(N; C).\nCorollary 13.3. Define the map S : L2(λR; C) -→l2(N; C) by\n[S(φ)](k) = (φ, hk)L2(λR;C).\nThen, for each m ≥0, S ↾S (m)(R; C) is an isometric isomorphism from S (m)(R; C)\nonto s(m)(N; C), and so S ↾S (R; C) is isometric homeomorphism from S (R; C)\nonto s(N; C).\nCorollary 13.3 means that any topological property of s(m)(N; C) or s(N; C) is a\nproperty of S (m)(R; C) or S (R; C), and the following lemma facilitates the study\nof such properties.\nLemma 13.4. Let {αk : k ≥0} ⊆(0, inf), and define the measure ν on N by\nν({k}) = αk. Then L2(ν; C) is a separable Hilbert space. In addition, a set B ⊆\nL2(ν; C) is relatively compact if and only if B is bounded and tight in the sense that\nlim\nK→infsup\ns∈B\nX\nk>K\nαk|s(k)|2 = 0.\nProof. Since the L2-space for any measure on a countably generated σ-algebra is a\nseparable Hilbert space, L2(ν; C) is a separable Hilbert space.\nSince L2(ν; C) is complete, to prove that a bounded, tight subset B is relatively\ncompact it suffices to show that B is totally bounded (i.e., for every r > 0 there is\na finite cover of B by balls of radius r with centers in B). To that end, let r > 0\nbe given, and choose K so that\nsup\ns∈B\nX\nk>K\nαk|s(k)|2 < r2\n4 .\nNext, note that s(0), . . . , s(K) : s ∈B is a bounded subset of CK+1 and\ntherefore totally bounded there. Hence there exists a finite set {sj : 1 ≤j ≤J} ⊆B\nsuch that, for each s ∈B,\nmin\n1≤j≤J\nK\nX\nk=0\nαk|s(k) -sj(k)|2 < r2\n2 ,\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nwhich means that, for each s ∈B there exists a 1 ≤j ≤J such that\n∥s -sj∥2\nL2(ν;C) =\nK\nX\nk=0\nαk|s(k) -sj(k)|2 +\nX\nk>K\nαk|s(k) -sj(k)|2 ≤r2.\nFinally, suppose that B is relatively compact. Certainly it is bounded. To see\nthat it must be tight, suppose it were not. Then there would exist an ε > 0 such\nthat, for each K ∈N,\nsup\ns∈B\nX\nk>K\nαk|s(k)|2 > ε.\nThus we could find a sequence {sK : K ≥0} ⊆B with the property that\nP\nk>K αk|sK(k)|2 ≥ε, and, because B is relatively compact, we could choose it\nto be a sequence which converges to some t ∈L2(ν; C). But this would mean that\nX\nk>K\nαk|t(k)|2 ≥\nX\nk>K\nαk|sK(k)|2 -∥t -sK∥2\nL2(ν;C) ≥ε\nfor sufficient large K, and that would mean the t can't be in L2(ν; C).\n□\nSay that B ⊆S (R; C) is bounded in S (R; C) if\nsup\nφ∈B\n∥φ∥S (m)(R;C) < inffor each m ≥0.\nTheorem 13.5. S (m)(R; C) is a separable Hilbert space for each m ≥0, and\nS (R; C) is a complete separable metric space. Moreover, a subset B ⊆S (R; C) is\nrelatively compact if and only if it is bounded in S (R; C).\nProof. By Lemma 13.4 applied with αk = μm\nk , we know that each of the spaces\ns(m)(N; C) is a separable Hilbert space, and therefore, by Corollary 13.3, so is each\nS (m)(R; C).\nThus, since S (R; C) is dense in every S (m)(R; C), we can use a\ndiagonalization argument to find a sequence {φn : n ≥1} ⊆S (R; C) which is\ndense in S (m)(R; C) for all m ≥0. Since this means that\ninf\nn≥1 ∥φ -φn∥S (m)(R;C) = 0 for all φ ∈S (R; C) and m ≥0,\nit follows that\ninf\nn≥1 ρS (R;C)(φ, φn) = 0 for all φ ∈S (R; C).\nThat is, {φn : n ≥1} is dense in S (R; C), and so S (R; C) is separable.\nTo see that S (R; C) is complete, first use Lemma 13.4 and Corollary 13.3 to see\nthat each S (m)(R; C) is complete. Now suppose that {φn : n ≥1} ⊆S (R; C)\nis ρS (R;C)-Cauchy convergent. Then it is ∥· ∥S (m)(R;C)-Cauchy convergent for each\nm ≥0, and therefore it is convergent in each S (m)(R; C) to some element of\nS (m)(R; C). But if φn -→φ in S (m+1)(R; C), then φn -→φ in S (m)(R; C), and\nso there is a unique φ ∈Tinf\nm=0 S (m)(R; C) to which {φn : n ≥1} converges in\nS (m)(R; C) for all m ≥0. Therefore φ ∈S (R; C) and limn→infρS (φ, φn) = 0.\nFinally, suppose that B ⊆S (R; C) is relatively compact in S (R; C). Because\nB is then relatively compact in each S (m)(R; C) and therefore bounded there, it is\na bounded subset of S (R; C). Conversely, if B is bounded in S (R; C), in order to\nshow that it is relatively compact in S (R; C) we need only show that it is totally\nbounded there. To that end, first observe that it is bounded in each S (m)(R; C).\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nThus, by Lemma 13.4 and Corollary 13.3, we will know that it is relatively compact\nin S (m)(R; C) if\nlim\nK→infsup\nφ∈B\nX\nk>K\nμm\nk |(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)|2 = 0.\n(∗)\nBut\nX\nk>K\nμm\nk |(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)|2 ≤\nμK+1\n∥φ∥2\nS (m+1)(R;C),\nand so, since B is bounded in S (m+1)(R; C), (∗) holds. To complete the proof that\nB ρS -totally bounded, let r > 0 be given, and choose m so that 2-m < r\n2. Next,\nusing the fact that B is relatively compact in S (m)(R; C), choose {φj : 1 ≤j ≤\nJ} ⊆B so that\nsup\nφ∈B\nmin\n1≤j≤J ∥φ -φj∥S (m)(R;C) < r\n2,\nand conclude that\nB ⊆\nJ[\nj=1\nφ : ρS (R;C)(φ, φj) < r .\n□\nThe assertion in the following is one of the many virtues possessed by S (R; C).\nTheorem 13.6. The map φ ⇝ˆφ is an isomorphism from S (R; C) onto itself,\nand, for each m ≥0, ∥ˆφ∥S (m)(R;C) = (2π)\n2 ∥φ∥S (m)(R;C).\nProof. We already know that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism of L2(λR; C)\nonto L2(λR; C). In addition, by Theorem 12.2,\n( ˆφ, hk)L2(λR;C) = (2π)\n2 (-ı)k(φ, hk)L2(λR;C),\nand so\n∥ˆφ∥2\nS (m)(R;C) = 2π\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμm\nk |(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)|2 = 2π∥φ∥2\nS (m)(R;C).\n□\nExercise 13.1.

Show that there is a φ ∈S (R; C) such that\nφn -→φ in S (R; C).\nHint: Use Theorem 13.5.\nExercise 13.3. This exercise deals with the relationship between various function\nspaces.\n(i) Show that Cinf\nc (R; C) is a dense subset of S (R; C)\n(ii) Set\nC0(R; C) =\nß\nf ∈C(R; C) :\nlim\n|x|→inff(x) = 0\nTM\n.\nShow that C0(R; C) with the uniform norm is a Banach space in which both Cinf\nc\nand S (R; C) are dense subsets.\nExercise 13.4. For x ∈R and φ ∈S (R; C), define τxφ(y) = φ(x + y). Show\nthat τxφ ∈S (R; C) and that ∥τxφ∥(m)\nu\n≤2m(|x| ∨1)m∥φ∥(m)\nu\nfor all m ≥0. In\naddition, show that\n∥τx2φ -τx1φ∥(m)\nu\n≤2m|x1| ∨|x2| ∨1)m∥φ∥(m+1)\nu\n|x2 -x1|.\nHint: To prove the first estimate, check that\n|yk∂lτxφ(y)| ≤\n(r)\n(2|x|)m(∂lφ)(x + y)\n\nif |y| ≤2|x|\n2m(x + y)k(∂lφ)(x + y)\n\nif |y| ≥2|x|.\nTo prove the second estimate, assume that x1 ≤x2, note that\nτx2φ -τx1φ =\nZ x2\nx1\nτtφ′ dt,\nand therefore that\n∥τx2φ -τx1φ∥(m)\nu\n≤\nZ x2\nx1\n∥τtφ′∥(m)\nu\ndt.\nFinally, apply the first estimate.\n14. Tempered Distributions\nSchwartz developed the theory of distribution in order to provide a mathemati-\ncally rigorous way to describe the sort of generalized functions that appear in the\nwork by Boole and Heaviside in connection with applications of the Laplace trans-\nform to ordinary differential equations, and those that were somewhat later intro-\nduced by Sobolev for applications to partial differential equations. What Schwartz\nrealized is that generalized functions should be thought of in terms of their action\n(i.e., their L2(λR; C) inner product with) on smooth functions rather than their\nvalue (which won't exist in general) at points.\nTo make that idea mathematically precise, he said a generalized function, which\nhe called a distribution, should be a continuous linear functional on a topologi-\ncal vector space of smooth functions. One of the spaces Schwartz considered is\nCinf\nc (R; C), but the appropriate topology on that space is rather cumbersome (for\ninstance, elements don't have countable neighborhood bases). A second, and much\nmore tractable, choice is S (R; C). Because elements of S (R; C) need not have com-\npact support, an element of its dual space must satisfy restricted growth conditions\nand is therefore called a tempered distribution.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nRecall that the dual space X∗of a topological vector space X over C is the\nspace of continuous, C-valued linear functions on X. When, like S (R; C), all the\nelements of X have a countable neighborhood basis, a linear function Λ on X is\nan element of X∗if Λxn -→Λx whenever xn -→x in X. Because we want to\nthink of elements of S (R; C)∗as generalized functions which act via their L2-inner\nproduct with elements of S (R; C), we will use letters like u to denote elements of\nS (R; C)∗and write their action on φ ∈S (R; C) as ⟨φ, u⟩.\nLemma 14.1. For each u ∈S (R; C)∗there is an m ≥0 and a C ∈(0, inf) such\nthat\n|⟨φ, u⟩| ≤C∥φ∥S (m)(R;C) for all φ ∈S (R; C).\nProof. Because sets of the form ∥φ∥S (m)(R;C) ≤r form a neighborhood basis\nfor 0 in S (R; C), there is an m ≥0 and r > 0 such that |⟨φ, u⟩| ≤1 when\n∥φ∥S (m)(R;C) ≤r. Hence |⟨φ, u⟩| ≤r-1∥φ∥S (m)(R;C).\n□\nSimple as it is, Lemma 14.1 has many consequences. For example, it allows us\nto say that\n(14.1)\n⟨φ, u⟩=\ninf\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)⟨ hk, u⟩,\nwhere the series is absolutely convergent. Indeed, if |⟨φ, u⟩| ≤C∥φ∥S (m)(R;C), then\n|⟨ hk, u⟩| ≤Cμm\nk , and so, since |(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)| = μ-n\nk |(Hnφ, hk)L2(λR;C)| for all\nn ≥0, the series Pinf\nk=0(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)⟨ hk, u⟩is absolutely convergent. Hence, if\nφn = Pn\nk=0(φ, hk)L2(λR;C), then φn -→φ in S (R; C) and therefore\n⟨φ, u⟩= lim\nn→inf⟨φn, u⟩= lim\nn→inf\nn\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)⟨ hk, u⟩\n=\ninf\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)⟨ hk, u⟩.\nObviously, given a measurable function f : R -→C with at most polynomial\ngrowth, one can think of it as the element fλR of S (R; C)∗given by ⟨φ, fλR⟩=\nR\nφ f dλR, and in this way S (R; C) can be thought of as a subset of S (R; C)∗.\nAlthough the distribution corresponding to f is fλR, it is conventional to denote\nit by f instead, and we will adopt this convention.\nWe will need to know that S (R; C) is dense in S (R; C)∗. To see that it is, let\nu ∈S (R; C)∗, and set\nψn =\nn\nX\nk=0\n⟨ hk, u⟩ hk.\nClearly ψn ∈S (R; C), and, for each φ ∈S (R; C),\n(φ, ψn)L2(λR;C) =\nn\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)(ψn, hk)L2(λR;C)\n=\nn\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)⟨ hk, u⟩-→\ninf\nX\nk=0\n(φ, hk)L2(λR;C)⟨ hk, u⟩= ⟨φ, u⟩.\nThe importance of this density result is that it tells us how to extend contin-\nuous operators like Hs as continuous operators on S (R; C)∗.\nNamely, because\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\n(φ, Hsψ)L2(λR;C) = (Hsφ, ψ)L2(λR;C) for φ, ψ ∈S (R; C) and S (R; C) is dense in\nS (R; C)∗, the one and only continuous extension of Hs to S (R; C)∗is given by\n(14.2)\n⟨φ, Hsu⟩≡⟨Hsφ, u⟩.\nSince S (R; C) can be written as the intersection of the spaces S (m)(R; C),\nS (R; C)∗must be able to be written as the union of the spaces S (m)(R; C)\n∗. Of\ncourse, because S (m)(R; C) is a Hilbert space, Riesz's theorem provides an isomor-\nphism between S (m)(R; C)\n∗and S (m)(R; C). However, in order to be consistent\nwith the idea that ⟨φ, u⟩is a generalization of the L2 inner product, this is not the\nway we will think about S (m)(R; C)\n∗. Instead, we want to identify S (m)(R; C)\n∗\nas the Hilbert space\nS (-m)(R; C) =\n(\nu ∈S (R; C)∗:\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμ-m\nk\n|⟨ hk, u⟩|2 < inf\n)\nwith inner product\n(u, v)S (-m)(R;C) =\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμ-m\nk\n⟨ hk, u⟩⟨ hk, v⟩.\nRecall that if X is a Banach space and Λ ∈X∗, then ∥Λ∥X∗= sup{|Λ(x)| :\n∥x∥X = 1}.

In addition, if φ ≥0, then χmφ ≥0 = χmφ(0), and so, by\n(14.4), Λmφ ≥0. Similarly, for any φ ∈Cinf(0, 2-m+1)\\(0, 2-m-2); R, ∥φ∥uχm ±\nχmφ ≥0 = ∥φ∥uχm ± χmφ(0), and therefore |Λmφ| ≤Km∥φ∥u, where Km =\n⟨χm, u⟩. Hence, Λm admits a unique extension as a continuous linear functional\non C(0, 2-m+1) \\ (0, 2-m-2); R that is non-negativity preserving and has norm\nKm; and so, by the Riesz representation theorem, we know that there is a unique\nnon-negative Borel measure Mm on R such that Mm is supported on (0, 2-m+1) \\\n(0, 2-m-2), Km = Mm(R), and ⟨χmφ, u⟩=\nR\nR φ(y) Mm(dy) for all φ ∈S (R; R).\nNow define the Borel measure M on R by M = P\nm∈Z Mm.

Extending Continuous Operators on S (R; C) to S (R; C)∗\nThe extension that we made of the operators Hs to S (R; C)∗is a special case\nof the fact that many continuous linear maps of S (R; C) into S (R; C)∗determine\na unique continuous extension as a continuous map from S (R; C)∗itself. The key\nto making such an extension is contained in the following theorem.\nTheorem 15.1. Let A be a continuous map of S (R; C) into S (R; C)∗, and assume\nthat there is a continuous operator A∗on S (R; C) such that\nA∗φ, ψ\nL2(λR;C) = φ, Aψ\nL2(λR;C) for all φ, ψ ∈S (R; C).\nIf Au is defined for u ∈S (R; C)∗by\n(15.1)\n⟨φ, Au⟩= ⟨A∗φ, u⟩for φ ∈S (R; C),\nthen u ⇝Au is the unique extension of A as a continuous operator on S (R; C)∗.\nProof. Because A∗maps S (R; C) continuously into itself, for each m ≥0 there\nexists an n ≥0 and C < infsuch that ∥A∗φ∥S (m)(R;C) ≤C∥φ∥S (n)(R;C), and\ntherefore, if u ∈S (-m)(R; C), then\n|⟨φ, Au⟩| = |⟨A∗φ, u⟩| ≤∥A∗φ∥S (m)(R;C)∥u∥S (-m)(R;C) ≤C∥φ∥S (n)(R;C)∥u∥S (-m)(R;C).\nHence ∥Au∥S (-n)(R;C) ≤C∥u∥S (-m)(R;C), and so A maps S (-m)(R; C) continu-\nously into S (-n)(R; C).\nFurthermore, since S (R; C) is dense in S (R; C)∗and\n⟨φ, Aψ⟩= A∗φ, ψ\nL2(λR;C) for ψ ∈S (R; C), A is the one and only continuous\nextension to S (R; C)∗of A ↾S (R; C).\n□\nIf A : S (R; C) -→S (R; C)∗is a continuous map, we will say that a continuous\noperator A∗on S (R; C) is its adjoint if (A∗φ, ψ)L2(λR;C) = ⟨φ, Aψ⟩for all φ, ψ ∈\nS (R; C).\nGiven a continuous operator A on S (R; C)∗and m, n ∈Z\n∥A∥S (n)(R;C)→S (R;C)(m) = sup|Au∥S (m)(R;C) : ∥u∥S (n)(R;C) = 1 .\nThe argument given in the proof of Theorem 15.1 shows that, for m, n ∈N,\n(15.2)\n∥A∥S (-m)(R;C)→S (-n)(R;C) = ∥A∗∥S (n)(R;C)→S (m)(R;C).\nAmong the simplest maps to which Theorem 15.1 applies are φ ⇝xkφ and\nφ ⇝∂lφ. Indeed, the first of these is its own adjoint, and the adjoint of ∂lis (-∂)l.\nBy Lemma 13.1, the extensions of these maps take, respectively, S (-m)(R; C) into\nS (-m-k)(R; C) and S (-m)(R; C) into S (-m-l)(R; C).\nThe Fourier transform is a particularly important operator on S (R; C)∗, and its\nadjoint is given by φ ∈S (R; C) 7-→ˇφ ∈S (R; C).

In addition, since both sides of\nthe equation ⟨ˆφ, ˆu⟩= 2π⟨φ, u⟩are continuous functions of u ∈S (R; C)∗and, by\n(12.3), the equation holds when u ∈S (R; C),\n⟨ˆφ, ˆu⟩= (2π)⟨φ, u⟩.\nThe same continuity argument shows that\nc\n∂u = -ıξˆu, c\nxu = ı∂ˆu\nand that the Fourier inversion formula\n(ˆu)∨= 2πu = (ˇu)∧\nholds.\nComputing most Fourier transforms of functions is hard, and computing them\nof distributions can be even harder. Among those that are easy are those of xkδa,\n∂lδa and f ∈L1(λR; C) ∪L2(λR; C) when thought of as a tempered distribution.\nIndeed,\n⟨φ, ˆδa⟩= ˇφ(a) =\nZ\ne-ıaxφ(x) dx = ⟨φ, ea⟩,\nwhere ea(x) = eıax,\nHence, '\n∂lδa = (-ıξ)lea. To compute ˆf when f is thought of as a distribution, note\nthat\n⟨ˇφ, f⟩=\nZ\nf(ξ)\nAZ\ne-ıξxφ(x) dx\na\ndξ =\nZ\nφ(x) ˆf(x) dx = ⟨φ, ˆf⟩,\nand therefore, when f ∈L1(λR; C) is thought of as a distribution, its Fourier\ntransform is the distribution determined by the function ˆf ∈Cb(R; C).\nWhen\nf ∈L2(λR; C), one uses the fact that, as R →inf, 1[-R,R]f -→f in S (R; C)∗and\ntherefore bf = ˆf where ˆf = limR→infc\nfR is the L2-Fourier transform of f. Similarly,\nwhen μ is a finite Borel measure on R, ˆμ as a distribution is equal to the function\nˆμ given by\n(15.3)\nˆμ(ξ) =\nZ\neıξx μ(dx).\nTrickier is the computation of the Fourier transform of distributions like log |x|.\nOne way to do so is to observe that ∂log |x| = 1\nx and first compute d\nx-1. For that\npurpose, set fy(x) =\nx\nx2+y2 for y > 0, and observe that, as y ↘0, fy -→x-1 and\ntherefore \"\nfy -→d\nx-1 in S (R; C)∗. Next observe that observe that, by (7.11),\n\"\nfy(ξ) = lim\nR→inf\nZ R\n-R\nxeıξx\nx2 + y2 dx = ı lim\nR→inf\nZ R\n-R\nx sin x\nx2 + y2 dx = ıπsgn(ξ)e-y|ξ|.\nHence\n(15.4)\nd\nx-1 = ıπsgn.\nKnowing (15.4) one might expect that one can use c\n∂u = -ıξˆu to compute ÷\nlog |x|.\nHowever to do so it is necessary to confront a technical difficulty. Namely, ıπsgn(ξ)\n-ıξ\n=\n-π\n|ξ|, and |ξ|-1 is not a distribution. On the other hand,\nφ ⇝\nZ φ(ξ) -φ(0)e-ξ2\n|ξ|\ndξ\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nis a distribution. Thus, to overcome the problem, set u = log |x| and write\n⟨φ, ˆu⟩= ⟨φ -φ(0)\"\ng1, ˆu⟩+ φ(0)⟨\"\ng1, ˆu⟩.\nand note that ⟨\"\ng1, ˆu⟩= 2π\nR\ng1(x) log |x| dx. At the same time,\n⟨φ -φ(0)\"\ng1, ˆu⟩=\n*\nφ -φ(0)e-ξ2\nıξ\n, -ıξˆu\n+\n=\n*\nφ -φ(0)e-ξ2\nıξ\n, c\n∂u\n+\n= -π\n*\nφ -φ(0)e-ξ2\n|ξ|\n, λR\n+\n.\nHence\n⟨φ, ÷\nlog |x|⟩= -π\nZ φ(ξ) -φ(0)e-ξ2\n|ξ|\ndξ + 2πφ(0)\nZ\ng1(x) log |x| dx.\nNext, consider a differential operator L = PJ\nj=0 aj∂j where {a0, . . . , aJ} ⊆\nCinf(R; C) and all the aj's and their derivatives have at most polynomial growth. If\nL∗φ ≡\nJ\nX\nj=0\n(-1)j∂j(ajφ),\nthen it is clear that (L∗φ, ψ)L2(λR;C) = (φ, Lφ)L2(λR;C). To see that L∗is a contin-\nuous operator on S (R; C), we need the following lemma.\nLemma 15.2. Let f ∈Cinf(R; R), and assume that for each m ≥0 there exists an\nkm ≥0 such that\nFm ≡max\n1≤j≤m sup\nx∈R\n|∂jf(x)|\n|x|km ∨1 < inf.\nThen, for each m ≥0, there is a Cm < infsuch that\n∥φf∥S (m)(R;C) ≤CmFm∥φ∥S (m+km)(R;C).\nProof. By Exercise 13.1 with n = 0, it is sufficient for us to show that for each\nk, l∈N with k + l≤m, there is a ck,lsuch that\n∥xk∂l(φf)∥L2(λR;C) ≤ck,lFm∥φ∥S (m+km)(R;C).\nTo this end, remember that\n∂l(φf) =\nl\nX\nj=0\nC\nl\nj\na\n∂jφ∂l-jf,\nand\n∥xk∂jφ∂l-jf∥L2(λR;C) ≤Fm\n(1 + |x|km)xk∂jφ∥L2(λR;C)\n≤2 · 3m+kmFm∥φ∥S (m+km)(R;C)∥.\n□\nUsing Lemma 15.2, it easy to check that L∗is a continuous operator on S (R; C),\nand therefore L extends as a continuous operator on S (R; C)∗.\nAnother important operation is convolution. That is, given ψ ∈S (R; C), con-\nsider the operator Cψ on S (R; C) given by Cψη = η ∗ψ. Because '\nη ∗ψ = ˆη ˆψ,\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nLemma 15.2 guarantees that Cψ maps S (m)(R; C) continuously into itself for all\nm ≥0. In addition,\n⟨φ, ψ ∗η⟩=\nZZ\nφ(x) ψ(x -y) η(y) dxdy =\nZZ\nφ(x + y) ψ(x) η(y) dxdy = ⟨C∗\nψφ, η⟩\nwhere\nC∗\nψφ(y) =\nZ\nφ(x + y) ψ(x) dx.\nSince '\nC∗\nψφ(ξ) = ˆφ( ψ)∨, Lemma 15.2 again guarantees that, for all m ≥0, C∗\nψ maps\nS (m)(R; C) continuously into itself, and so Cψ has a unique continuous extension\nto S (R; C)∗, and this extention is a continuous map of S (m)(R; C) into itself for\nall m ∈Z.\nIn order to gain a better understanding of Cψ, we need to use the translation maps\nτx : S (R; C) -→S (R; C) defined in Exercise 13.4, and define ψ ∗u(x) = ⟨τ-xψ, u⟩\nfor u ∈S (R; C)∗and x ∈R.\nTheorem 15.3. For ψ ∈S (R; C) and u ∈S (R; C)∗, ψ∗u is a continuous function\nwith at most polynomial growth, and Cψu = ψ ∗u. In addition, '\nψ ∗u = ˆψˆu, and\nψ ∗u = (2π)-1( ˆψˆu)∨.\nProof. By Exercise 13.4, x ⇝τ-xψ is a continuous map of S (R; C) into itself and\ntherefore that ψ ∗u ∈C(R; C). Also, the estimates given in that Exercise and\nLemma 13.1 show that\n|ψ ∗u(x)| ≤2mKm(|x| ∨1)m∥ψ∥S (m+3)(R;C)∥u∥S (-m-3)(R;C),\nand therefore ψ ∗u has at most polynomial growth.\nTuring to the proof that Cψu = ψ ∗u, suppose that u ∈S (-m)(R; C) and set\nun = Pn\nk=0 ⟨ hk, u⟩ hk. Then un ∈S (R; C) and un -→u in S (-m)(R; C). Since\nCψun = ψ∗un, we will know that Cψu = ψ∗u once we show that that ψ∗un -→ψ∗u\nin S (R; C)∗. To that end, note that, by Theorem 13.2 and that Exercise 13.4,\n|ψ ∗(un -u)(x)| ≤∥τ-xψ∥S (m)(R;C)∥un -u∥S (-m)(R;C)\n≤Km∥τ-xψ∥(m+1)\nu\n∥un -u∥S (-m)(R;C)\n≤2(m+1)Km(|x| ∨1)m+1∥ψ∥(m+1)\nu\n∥un -u∥S (-m)(R;C),\nand so ψ ∗un -→ψ ∗u in S (R; C)∗.\nFinally, since '\nψ ∗u = ˆψˆu and ψ ∗u = (2π)-1 ˆψˆu∨when u ∈S (R; C), the\nS (R; C)∗-continuity of u ⇝ψ ∗u guarantees that these continue to hold for all\nu ∈S (R; C)∗.\n□\nA simple, but typical, application of these results is to the ordinary differential\nequation λu -u′′ = μ, where λ > 0 and μ is a finite Borel measure on R. The\nsolution u to this equation describes the electric potential along a wire produced by\na charge distribution μ when the wire has resistance that is a linear function of the\npotential. To solve this equation, assume that u ∈S (R; C)∗, and take the Fourier\ntransform of both sides. Then λˆu + ξ2ˆu = ˆμ, and so ˆu =\nˆμ\nλ+ξ2 . Next observe (cf.\n(7.5)) that\nλ+ξ2 = \"\nGλ, where\nGλ(x) =\n2λ\n2 e-λ\n2 |x|.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nEven though Gλ /∈S (R; C), it and the function x ⇝Gλ ∗μ(x) ≡\nR\nGλ(x-y) μ(dy)\nare elements of L1(λR; C) and therefore of S (R; C)∗.\nIn addition, by Fubini's\ntheorem, ÷\nGλ ∗μ = \"\nGλˆμ, and so\nu(x) =\n2λ\nZ\ne-λ\n2 |x-y| μ(dy).\nIt is an instructive exercise to check that this u is a solution. To this end, first\nuse Exercise 14.1 to see that u′ is the function\nu′(x) = λ\nZ\nsgn(y -x)e-λ\n2 |x-y| dy.\nThus\n⟨φ, u′′⟩= -⟨φ′, u′⟩=\nZ\nφ′(x)\nA1\nZ\nsgn(x -y)e-λ\n2 |x-y|φ′(y) μ(dy)\na\ndx\n=\nZ A1\nZ\nsgn(x -y)e-λ\n2 |x-y|φ′(x) dx\na\nμ(dy).\nNext note that\nZ\nsgn(x -y)e-λ\n2 |x-y|φ′(x) dx =\nZ inf\ny\neλ\n2 (y-x)φ′(x) dx -\nZ y\n-inf\neλ\n2 (x-y)φ′(x) dx\n= -φ(y) + λ\nZ inf\ny\neλ\n2 (y-x) dx -φ(y) + λ\nZ y\n-inf\neλ\n2 (x-y) dx = -2φ(y) + 2λu(y),\nand therefore ⟨φ, u′′⟩= -⟨φ, μ⟩+ λ⟨φ, u⟩, which means that λu -u′′ = μ.\nExercise 15.1.

STROOCK\n16. Moving to RN\nWith essentially no new ideas and the introduction of only slightly uglier nota-\ntion, we will transfer most of the contents of §§7-15 to RN.\nIf f ∈L1(RN; C), its Fourier transform is the function\nˆf(ξ) =\nZ\neı(ξ,x)RN f(x) dx,\nand, using exactly the same arguments as we did when N = 1, one can easily show\nthat ∥ˆf∥u ≤∥f∥L1(λRN ;C), ˆf is continuous and that, if f ∈C1(RN; C) ∩L1(λRN ; C)\nand f ′ ∈L1(λRN ; C), then '\n∂xjf(ξ) = -ıξj ˆf(ξ) for 1 ≤j ≤N, from which it follows\nthat ˆf(ξ) -→0 as |ξ| →inf.\nTo develop an inversion formula, one introduces the functions\ngt(x) = (2πt)-N\n2 e-|x|2\n2t ,\nuses Fubini's theorem to check that \"\ngt(ξ) = e-t|ξ|2\n2 , and proceeds as before to see\nfirst that\nZ\ngt(x -y)f(y) dy = (2π)-N\nZ\ne-t|ξ|2\n2 e-ı(ξ,x)RN ˆf(ξ) dξ,\nand then that, as t ↘0,\n(2π)-N\nZ\ne-t|ξ|2\n2 e-ı(ξ,x)RN ˆf(ξ) dx converges to\n(r)\nf\nin L1(λRN ; C)\nf(x)\nif f is continuous at x.\nThe normalized Hermite functions on RN are indexed by m = (m1, . . . , mN) ∈\nNN and defined by\nhm(x) = hn1(x1) · · · hnN (xN).\nBy standard results about products of Hilbert spaces, one knows that they form an\northonormal basis in L2(λRN ; C). In addition, if\nH = |x|2 -∆=\nN\nX\nj=1\nx2\nj -∂2\nxj\n,\nthen\nH hm = μm hm where μm =\nN\nX\nj=1\nμmj\nand\n( hm)∧= ı∥m∥1(2π)\nN\n2 hm where ∥m∥1 =\nN\nX\nj=1\nmj.\nFinally, the estimates in (11.2) can be used to show that\n(16.1)\n∥ hm∥L1(λRN ;C) ≤\nN\nN\nY\nj=1\n2π(mj + 1)\ne 1\n, ∥ hm∥u ≤\nN\nN\nY\nj=1\n(mj + 1)\ne 1\nand\n∥xj hm∥u ∨∥∂xj hm∥u ≤2N\nN\nY\nj=1\n(mj + 1).\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nThe Schwartz test function space S (RN; C) for RN is defined as the space of\nφ ∈Cinf(RN; C) with the property that ∥xk\ni ∂l\nxjφ∥u < inffor all 1 ≤i, j ≤N and\nk, l∈N. Again one introduces the operators\nHsφ =\nX\nk∈NN\nμs\nk(φ, hk)L2(λRN ;C) hk\nand defines the norms\n∥φ∥(m)\nu\n=\nmax\n1≤i,j≤N\nk+l≤m\n∥xi∂xjφ∥u\nand\n∥φ∥S (R;C)(m)(RN;C) =\nX\nk∈NN\nμm\nk |(φ, hk)L2(λRN ;C)|2,\nand the spaces\nS (m)(RN; C) = {φ ∈Cinf(RN; C) : ∥φ∥S (R;C)(m) < inf}.\nClearly, if φ ∈S (m)(R; C), then ∥φ∥S (R;C)(m) = ∥H\nm\n2 φ∥L2(λRN ;C).\nUsing the estimates in (16.1) and the reasoning in Lemma 13.1 and Theorem\n13.2, one sees that, for each m there is a Km ∈(0, inf) such that\n∥φ∥S (m)(RN;C) ≤Km∥φ∥(m+N)\nu\nand\n∥φ∥(m)\nu\n≤Km∥φ∥S (m+3N)(RN;C).\nHence, S (RN; C) = Tinf\nm=0 S (m)(RN; C) and S (RN; C)\n∗can be identified as the\nunion Sinf\nm=0 S (-m)(RN; C) where S (-m)(RN; C) is the analog for N ≥2 of\nS (-m)(R; C) for N = 1. Further, the obvious analogs of Theorems 14.3 and 14.5\nhold. In proving the analogs of Theorems 14.5 and 14.7, one needs to use the RN\nversion of Taylor's theorem which says that\nφ(x) =\nn\nX\nm=0\nX\n∥k∥1=m\n∂kφ(0)\nk!\nxk + 1\nn!\nX\n∥k∥1=n+1\nC\nn + 1\nk\na\nxk\nZ 1\n(1 -t)n∂kφ(tx) dt,\nwhere k! = QN\nj=1 kj, xk = QN\nj=1 xkj\nj , ∂k = QN\nj=1 ∂kj\nxj , and n+1\nk\nis the multinomial\ncoefficient (n+1)!\nk!\n.\nOnce one has the preceding, it should be clear how to extend a continuous map\nA : S (RN; C) -→S (RN; C)\n∗to continuous operators on S (RN; C)\n∗if A admits\nan adjoint A∗which is a continuous operator on S (RN; C). In particular, both the\nFourier transform and convolution have such extensions.\nThe extension of the Fourier transform to L2(λRN ; C) can be done as follows.\nFirst note that if φ ∈S (RN; C), then\nφ, hm\n\nL2(λRN ;C) = μ-n\nm\nHnφ, hm\n\nL2(λRN ;C),\nand therefore, using the first estimate in (16.1), one see that\nφn ≡\nX\n∥m∥1≤n\n(φ, hm)L2(λRN ;C) hm -→φ\nin L1(λRN ; C) as well as L2(λRN ; C). Thus, ∥ˆφn -ˆφ∥u -→0, and so\nˆφ = (2π)\nN\ninf\nX\nm=0\nı∥m∥1(φ, hm)L2(λRN ;C) hm\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nfor φ ∈S (R; C). Next suppose that f ∈L1(λRN ; C) ∩L2(λRN ; C), and set\nφn =\nX\n∥m∥1≤n\n(f, hm)L2(λRN ;C) hm ∈S (RN; C).\nThen φn -→f in L2(λRN ; C), and so, by Fatou's lemma, one sees that ∥ˆf∥L2(λRN ;C) ≤\n(2π)\nN\n2 ∥f∥L2(λRN ;C). Hence the Fourier transform on L1(λRN ; C) ∩L2(λRN ; C) ad-\nmits a unique extension as a continuous operator on L2(λRN ; C). In particular, for\nall f ∈L2(λRN ; C),\nˆf(ξ) = lim\nR→inf\nZ\n|x|≤R\neı(ξ,x)RN f(x) dx,\nwhere the convergence is in L2(λRN ; C). Also\nˆf = (2π)\nN\nX\nm∈NN\nı∥m∥1f, hm\n\nL2(λRN ;C) hm,\nand so the Parseval identity\n( ˆf, ˆg)L2(λRN ;C) = (2π)N(f, g)L2(λRN ;C)\nholds for all f, g ∈L2(λRN ; C), from which the Fourier inversion formula ( ˆf)∨=\n(2π)Nf = ( ˇf)∨follows in the same way that it did when N = 1.\nFinally, by\nthe same argument used when N = 1, one can show that '\n∂xjf = -ıξjˆh if f ∈\nL2(λRN ; C) ∩C1(RN; C) and ∂xjf ∈L2(λRN ; C).\nTo demonstrate the use these considerations, consider again the example dis-\ncussed at the end of §15, only now its analog λu -∆u = μ in RN, where λ > 0\nand μ is a finite Borel measure on RN. Just as before, the Fourier transform of this\nequation lead to the conclusion that ˆu =\nˆμ\nλ+|ξ|2 . To find the function Gλ of which\n(λ + |ξ|2)-1 is the Fourier transform, note that\nλ + |ξ|2 =\nZ inf\ne-t(λ+|ξ|2) dt =\nZ inf\ne-λt\"\ng2t(ξ) dt,\nfrom which it follows that\nGλ(x) =\nZ inf\ne-λtg2t(x) dt = (4π)-1\nZ inf\nt-N\n2 e-λt-|x|2\n4 dt.\nThe function Gλ is a Bessel function, and a more explicit expression for it is easy\nto obtain only when N is odd. For example, when N = 1, we already knew that\nGλ(x) =\n2λ-1\n2 e-λ\n2 |x|, and when N = 3, after differentiating (7.6) with respect to\nx, one sees that\nGλ(x) = e-λ\n2 |x|\n2π|x| .\nIn any case, Gλ ∈L1(λR; C), and it is clear that if a solution u ∈S (RN; C)\n∗exists,\nthen it is the function\nx ⇝Gλ ∗μ(x) ≡\nZ\nGλ(x -y) μ(dy).\n(∗)\nAlso, if the function Gλ ∗μ is an element of S (RN; C)\n∗, for instance if\nZ\n(1 + |x|2)-m\nAZ\nGλ(x -y) μ(dy)\na\ndx < inf,\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nthen the function in (∗) determines the u ∈S (RN; C)\n∗which is the one and only\nsolution in S (RN; C)\n∗.\nThe Poisson problem ∆u = -μ is a closely related to the preceding, but are two\nreasons why this problem is more difficult than the preceding one. The first reason\nis that, if one exists, then there is more than one solution. Indeed, if u is a solution\nand ∆v = 0, then u + v is again a solution. A v satisfying ∆v = 0 is said to be\nharmonic, and there are lots of them. To see this, observe that ∆v = 0 ⇐⇒|ξ|2ˆv =\nand that |ξ|2ˆv = 0 implies that {0} is the support of ˆv, which by Theorem 14.5\nmeans that it is a linear combination of δ0 and its derivatives and therefore that v\nmust be a polynomial. 14.5 means that ˆv is a linear combination of derivatives of δ0\nand therefore that v is a polynomial. Thus, v ∈S (R; C)∗is harmonic harmonic if\nand only if v = ax + b. When N ≥2, there are harmonic polynomials of all orders.\nFor example, the real part of any complex polynomial will be a harmonic element\nof S (R2; C).\nThe second difficulty is that when N ∈{1, 2},\n|ξ|2 /∈S (RN; C)\n∗, and there-\nfore\nˆμ\n|ξ|2 is not the Fourier transform of the convolution of u with an element of\nL1(λR; C). Nonetheless, when N = 1 and\nR\n|y| μ(dy) < inf, one can check by hand\nthat if G(1)\n0 (x) = x-, then u = G(1)\n∗μ is an element of S (R; C)∗which satisfies\n∆u = -μ. When N = 2, one can use Green's formula and the divergence theorem\nto show that\nZ\n∆φ(x) log |x -y| dx = 2πφ(y)\nfor φ ∈S (R; C), and therefore, if G(2)\n0 (y) ≡-1\n2π log |y| and there is an m ≥0 for\nwhich\nZ\n(1 + |x|2)-m\nAZ G(2)\n0 (x -y)\nμ(dy)\na\ndx < inf,\nthen the function\nx ⇝\nZ\nG(2)\n0 (x -y) μ(dy)\ndetermines a solution u ∈S (R; C)(R2; C)∗.\nWhen N ≥3, one should look for the tempered distribution of which |ξ|-2 is\nthe Fourier transform. To that end, observe that\n|ξ|2 =\nZ inf\ne-t|ξ|2 dt =\nZ inf\n\"\ng2t(ξ) dt,\nand so |ξ|-2 is the Fourier transform of\nG0(x) = (4π)-N\nZ inf\nt-N\n2 e-|x|2\n4t dt =\n4π\nN\n2 |x|N-2\nZ inf\nt\nN\n2 -2e-t dt =\nΓ N-2\n\n4π\nN\n2 |x|N-2 ,\nwhere Γ is Euler's gamma function. Because Γ N\n= N-2\n2 Γ N-2\nand\n2π\nN\nΓN\nis\nthe area ωN-1 of the unit sphere SN-1 in RN, we have that\nG(N)\n(x) =\n(N -2)ωN-1|x|N-2 .\nThus, if the function\nx ⇝\nZ\nG(N)\n(x -y) μ(dy)\n\nDANIEL W.

Show that if f is an entire function on C (i.e., an analytic function\nthere), then, as a function on R2 it is tempered distribution if and only if it is a\npolynomial. Conclude that if an entire function is not a polynomial, then it grows\nat infinity faster that any power of z.\n17. Convergence of Probability Measures\nDefine M1(RN) to be the set of Borel probability measures on RN.\nClearly\nM1(RN) is a convex subset of S (RN; C)∗, but it is a subset that possesses prop-\nerties that are not shared by most other elements of S (RN; C)\n∗, and the topology\nof S (RN; C)\n∗does not take full advantage of those properties. There are three\nstronger topologies that recommend themselves. Namely: the uniform topology,\nwhich is the one for which8\n∥μ -ν∥var ≡sup|⟨φ, μ -ν⟩| : φ a Borel measurable function with ∥φ∥u = 1\nis the metric; the strong for which sets of the form\nS(μ, r; φ1, . . . , φn) = ν : |⟨φm, ν -μ⟩| < r for 1 ≤m ≤n ,\nwhere φm's are bounded Borel measurable R-valued functions on RN, are a neigh-\nborhood basis for μ; and the weak for which sets of the S(μ, r; φ1, . . . , φn) are a\nneighborhood basis for μ, only now with the restriction that φm's must be contin-\nuous as well as bounded.\nObviously, the strength of the uniform topology is greater than that of the strong\ntopology, which is stronger than the weak topology, which, at first sight (cf. Exercise\n17.1), looks stronger than the one which M1(RN) inherits as a subset of S (RN; C)\n∗.\nEach of them has its virtues and flaws. The uniform topology admits a metric and\nis the strong topology on the dual space of the Banach space C0(RN; R) with\nthe uniform topology; the strong topology is not separable and points don't have\ncountable neighborhood bases; as we will show below, the weak topology is both\nseparable and admits a metric. In addition, convergence of measures in the weak\ntopology is intimately related to the convergence of their Fourier transforms.\nIn what follows, we will study some of the properties and applications of the\nweak topology.\nLemma 17.1. The sets S(μ, r; φ1, . . . , φn) with φ1, . . . , φn ∈Cinf\nc (RN; R) are a\nneighborhood basis at μ for the weak topology.\nProof. We begin by showing if that φ ∈Cinf\nb (R; C) with ∥φ∥u = 1 and r > 0, then\nthere exist φ1, φ2 ∈Cinf\nc (RN; C) such that\nν : |⟨φ1, ν -μ⟩| ∨|⟨φ2, ν -μ⟩| < r\n⊆{ν : |⟨φ, ν -μ⟩| < r}.\nTo this end, choose R > 0 so that μB(0, R) > 1 -r\n4, and take η ∈Cinf(RN; R)\nso that η = 1 on B(0, R) and η = 0 off B(0, R + 1). Then\n|⟨φ, ν -μ⟩| ≤|⟨ηφ, ν -μ⟩| + |⟨(1 -η)φ, ν -μ⟩|\n8We will continue to use ⟨φ, μ⟩to denote the integral with respect to μ of a function φ, even\nif φ /∈S (RN; C). Also, ⟨φ, ν -μ⟩≡⟨φ, ν⟩-⟨φ, μ⟩.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nand\n|⟨(1 -η)φ, ν -μ⟩| ≤⟨1 -η, μ⟩+ ⟨1 -η, ν⟩\n≤2⟨1 -η, μ⟩+ |⟨1 -η, ν -μ⟩| = 2⟨1 -η, μ⟩+ |⟨η, ν -μ⟩|.\nThus\n|⟨(1 -η)φ, ν -μ⟩| ≤|⟨ηφ, ν -μ⟩| + 2μB(0, R)∁ + |⟨η, ν -μ⟩|,\nand so\nν : |⟨ηφ, ν -μ⟩| ∨|⟨η, ν -μ⟩| < r\n⊆{ν : |⟨φ, ν -μ⟩| < r}.\nIn view of the preceding, it suffices to show that if φ ∈Cc(RN; C) with ∥φ∥u = 1\nand r > 0, then there exists a ψ ∈Cinf\nc (RN; C) such\n|⟨ψ, ν -μ⟩| < r\n3 =⇒|⟨φ, ν -μ⟩| < r.\nTo this end, simply choose ψ ∈Cinf\nc (RN; C) so that ∥φ -ψ∥u < r\n3, and check that\nthis ψ will serve.\n□\nAs Lemma 17.1 makes clear, what we are calling the weak topology on M1(RN)\nis what a functional analyst would call the weak* topology on the dual space\nC0(RN; R)∗of the Banach space C0(RN; R) (the space of continuous functions that\ntend to 0 at infinity) with the uniform norm. Indeed, the Riesz representation theo-\nrem allows one to identify C0(RN; R) with the space of finite signed Borel measures\non RN, and so M1(RN) can be thought of as a convex subset of the unit ball in\nC0(RN; R)∗, in which case Lemma 17.1 shows that the weak topology on M1(RN) is\nthe topology M1(RN) inherits as a subset from the weak* topology on C0(RN; R)∗.\nTheorem 17.2. The weak topology on M1(RN) is a separable, metric topology.\nProof. Let {φk : k ≥1} be a dense subset of Cc(RN; R), and define\nρ(μ, ν) =\ninf\nX\nk=1\n|⟨φk, ν -μ⟩|\n2k(1 + |⟨φk, ν -μ⟩|).\nUsing Lemma 17.1, it is easy to check that φ is a metric for the weak topology on\nM1(RN).\nTo prove separability, define D to be the set of measures Pn\nm=1 amδxm, where\nn ≥1, the am's are non-negative rational numbers whose sum is 1, and the xm's\nare elements of RN with rational coordinates. Clearly D is countable. Therefore\nit suffices to show that, for each μ ∈M1(RN), each cellection {φ1, . . . , φl} ⊆\nCb(RN; R), and ε > 0, there is a ν ∈D such that max1≤k≤l|⟨φk, ν -μ⟩| < ε.\nFurther, we need do so only for φk's and a μ which are supported on a ball B(0, R).\nGiven such φk's and μ, choose r > 0 so that max1≤k≤l|φk(y) -φk(x)| <\nε\n2 if\n|y -x| < r. Next, cover B(0, R) with balls B(xm, r), where 1 ≤m ≤n, each\nxm ∈B(0, R) and has rational coordinates, and define A1 = B(x1, r) and Am =\nB(xm, r)\\Sm-1\nk=1 Ak for 2 ≤m ≤n.

Given {μn : n ≥1}∪{μ} ⊆M1(RN), the following are equivalent:\n(i) μn\nw\n-→μ.\n(ii) |⟨φ, μn -μ⟩| -→0 for all φ ∈Cinf\nc (RN; R).\n(iii) For all closed sets F ⊆RN, limn→infμn(F) ≤μ(F).\n(iv) For all open sets G ⊆RN, limn→infμn(G) ≥μ(G).\n(v) For all upper continuous functions f : RN -→R that are bounded above,\nlimn→inf⟨f, μn⟩≤⟨f, μ⟩.\n(vi) For all lower continuous functions f : RN -→R that are bounded below,\nlimn→inf⟨f, μn⟩≥⟨f, μ⟩.\nFinally, if Γ ∈B and its boundary ∂Γ has μ-measure 0, then μn\nw\n-→μ\n=⇒\nμ(Γ) = limn→infμn(Γ).\nProof. We already proved in Lemma 17.1 the equivalence of (i) and (ii), and the\nequivalence of (iii) and (iv) as well as that of (v) and (vi) is obvious. In addition,\nit is clear that (v) together with (vi) implies (i). Thus, we need only check that (i)\nimplies (iii) and that (iv) implies (vi).\nAssume that μn\nw\n-→μ. Given a closed set F, define φk(x) = 1 -\nA\n|x-F |\n1+|x-F |\na 1\nk .\nThen φk ∈CRN; [0, 1] and φk ↘1F as k →inf. Hence, for all k,\n⟨φk, μ⟩= lim\nn→inf⟨φk, μn⟩≥lim\nn→infμn(F),\nand so μ(F) = limk→inf⟨φk, μ⟩≥limn→infμn(F). Thus (i) =⇒(iii).\nIn proving that (iv) implies (vi), it suffices to handle f's which are positive as\nwell as lower semicontinuous. Given such an f, define\nfk =\ninf\nX\nj=1\nj ∧4k\n2k\n1Ij,k *f = 1\n2k\n4k\nX\nj=1\n1Jj,k *f,\nwhere\nIj,k =\nA j\n2k , j + 1\n2k\no\nand Jj,k =\nA j\n2k , inf\na\n.\nThen 0 ≤fk ↗f as k →inf. In addition, because f is lower semicontinuous, the\nsets Gj,k = {x : f(x) ∈Jj,k} are open. Hence, if (iv) holds, then, for all k,\n⟨fk, μ⟩≤lim\nn→inf\n⟨fk, μn⟩≤lim\nn→inf\n⟨f, μn⟩,\nand so\n⟨f, μ⟩= lim\nk→inf⟨fk, μ⟩≤lim\nn→inf\n⟨f, μn⟩.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nTo prove the concluding assertion, assume μn\nw\n-→μ and that μ(∂Γ) = 0.

Assume that μn\nw\n-→μ, let ψ ∈CRN; [0, inf) be an element of\nL1(μ; R) as well as of Tinf\nn=1 L1(μn; R). Then ⟨ψ, μ⟩≤limn→inf⟨ψ, μn⟩. In addition,\nif {φn : n ≥1} ⊆C(RN; R), |φn| ≤ψ for all n ≥1, and ⟨ψ, μn⟩-→⟨ψ, μ⟩, then\n⟨φn, μn⟩-→⟨φ, μ⟩if φn -→φ uniformly on compact subsets.\nProof. Clearly,\n⟨ψ ∧R, μ⟩= lim\nn→inf⟨ψ ∧R, μn⟩≤lim\nn→inf\n⟨ψ, μn⟩\nfor all R > 0, and so ⟨ψ, μ⟩≤limn→inf⟨ψ, μn⟩.\nNow suppose that ⟨ψ, μn⟩-→⟨ψ, μ⟩, that |φn| ≤ψ, and that φn -→φ uni-\nformly on compact subsets. Clearly\n|⟨φn, μn⟩-⟨φ, μ⟩| ≤|⟨φn -φ, μn⟩| + |⟨φ, μ -μn⟩|.\nFor each R > 0, choose ηR ∈CinfRN; [0, 1] so that ηR = 1 on B(0, R) and ηR = 0\noff B(0, R + 1). Then, for each R > 0,\nlim\nn→inf|⟨φn -φ, μn⟩|\n≤lim\nn→inf\nsup\n|x|≤R+1\n|φn(x) -φ(x)|⟨ηR, μn⟩+ lim\nn→inf|⟨(1 -ηR)(φn -φ), μn⟩|\n≤2 lim\nn→inf⟨(1 -ηR)ψ, μn⟩= 2⟨(1 -ηR)ψ, μ⟩,\nand, by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, the last expression tends to 0\nas R →inf. Similarly, for all R > 0,\nlim\nn→inf|⟨φ, μn -μ⟩|\n≤lim\nn→inf|⟨ηRφ, μn -μ⟩| + lim\nn→inf⟨(1 -ηR)ψ, μn⟩+ ⟨(1 -ηR)ψ, μ⟩≤2⟨(1 -ηR)ψ, μ⟩,\nand so limn→inf|⟨φ, μn -μ⟩| = 0.\n□\nWe will next investigate when a subset of M1(RN) is relatively compact. Because\nthe unit ball in the dual space of a Banach is compact in the weak* topology, a\ncareless functional analyst might think that M1(RN) is itself compact. However,\nalthough M1(RN) is closed in the strong topology on C0(RN; R)∗, it is not closed\nin the weak* topology. Indeed, the sequence {δn : n ≥1} ⊆M1(R) is weak*\nconvergent to the measure whose total mass is 0, which is not an element of M1(R).\nAs this example indicates, in order for the weak* limit of a sequence {μn : n ≥1}\n⊆M1(RN) to be in M1(RN), one needs to know that the mass of the μn's is not\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nescaping to infinity. With that in mind, we will say that a subset A of M1(RN) is\ntight if, for each ε ∈(0, 1), there exists an R ∈[0, inf) such that\ninf\nμ∈A μB(0, R) ≥1 -ε.\nTheorem 17.5. A subset A ⊆M1(RN) is relatively compact in the weak topology\nif and only if it is tight.\nProof. Assume that A is tight, and let {μn : n ≥1} ⊆A. As pointed out above,\nthere is a subsequence of {μn : n ≥1} which is weak* convergent in C0(RN; R)∗\nto a ν ∈C0(RN; R)∗which is a non-negative measure with total mass less than or\nequal to 1, and so, without loss in generality, we will assume that {μn : n ≥1} is\nweak* convergent to ν. In order to check that ν(RN) = 1, for any ε ∈(0, 1) choose\nR so that infn≥1 μn\nB(0, R) ≥1 -ε, and choose η ∈CRN; [0, 1] so that η = 1\non B(0, R) and η = 0 off B(0, R + 1). Then\nν(RN) ≥νB(0, R + 1) ≥⟨η, ν⟩= lim\nn→inf⟨η, μn⟩≥lim\nn→infμn\nB(0, R) ≥1 -ε,\nand so ν(RN) must be 1.\nConversely, suppose that A ⊆M1(RN) is relatively compact in the weak topol-\nogy. If A were not tight, then there would exist a θ ∈[0, 1) and, for each n ≥1, a\nμn ∈A such that μn\nB(0, n) ≤θ, and, because A is relatively compact, we could\nassume that μn\nw\n-→μ for some μ ∈M1(RN). But if ηm ∈CRN; [0, 1] equals 1 on\nB(0, m) and 0 off of B(0, m + 1), that would mean that, for all m ≥1,\nμB(0, m) ≤⟨ηm, μ⟩= lim\nn→inf⟨ηm, μn⟩≤lim\nn→inf\nμn\nB(0, n) ≤θ,\nand so μ(RN) would have to be less than or equal to θ < 1.\n□\nExercise 17.1.

The Fourier Transform for M1(RN)\nIn many applications, it is important to know the relationship between the weak\nconvergence of measures and convergence of their Fourier transforms, which are\noften called characteristic functions in the probability literature.\nTheorem 18.1. Given {μn : n ≥1} ∪{μ} ⊆M1(RN), μn\nw\n-→μ if and only if\nˆμn(ξ) -→ˆμ(ξ) for each ξ ∈RN. In fact, if μn\nw\n-→μ, then ˆμn -→ˆμ uniformly on\ncompact subsets.\nProof. Suppose that ˆμn -→ˆμ pointwise. Then, by Parseval's identity and Lebesgue's\ndominated convergence theorem, for each φ ∈S (RN; C),\n(2π)N⟨φ, μn⟩=\nZ\nˆφ(ξ)ˆμn(-ξ) dξ -→\nZ\nˆφ(ξ)ˆμ(-ξ) dξ = (2π)N⟨φ, μ⟩,\nand so, by Theorem 17.3, μn\nw\n-→μ.\nNow suppose that μn\nw\n-→μ and that ξn -→ξ in RN. Then the functions φn(x) =\neı(ξn,x)RN converge uniformly on compact subsets to the function φ(x) = eı(ξ,x),\nand therefore, by Theorem 17.4, ˆμn(ξn) -→ˆμ(ξ). Hence ˆμn -→μ uniformly on\ncompact subsets.\n□\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nUndoubtedly the most famous application of Theorem 18.1 is to the derivation\nof the Central Limit Theorem in probability theory.\nThe C.L.T. states that if\n{Xn : n ≥1} is a sequence of RN-valued, mutually independent, uniformly square\nintegrable random variables on some probability space (Ω, F, P) have the properties\nthat their expected value is 0 and\nlim\nn→inf\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nE(ξ, Xm)2\nRN\n= |ξ|2\nfor all ξ ∈RN, then the distribution σn of\nPn\nm=1 Xm\nn\nconverges weakly to γN, where γ(dx) = (2π)-1\n2 e-x2\n2 dx is the standard Gaussian\nmeasure on R.

The following theorem of P. L evy shows how one can\nuse Fourier transforms to test for tightness.\nTheorem 18.2.

A function f : RN -→C is a characteristic function if and only\nif f is continuous, f(0) = 1, and f is non-negative definite.\nProof. Assume that f = ˆμ for some μ ∈M1(RN). Then it is obvious that f is\ncontinuous and that f(0) = 1. To see that it is non-negative definite, observe that\nn\nX\nj,k=1\nf(ξj -ξk)αjαk =\nZ N\nn\nX\nj,k=1\nei(ξj-ξk,x)RN αjαk\ne\nμ(dx)\n=\nZ\nn\nX\nj,k=1\neiξjxαj\n\nμ(dx) ≥0.\nNow assume that f is a continuous, non-negative definite function with f(0) = 1.\nBecause\nA ≡\nA\nf(ξ)\nf(-ξ)\na\nis non-negative definite, Imf(ξ) + f(-ξ) and Imif(ξ) -if(-ξ) are both 0,\nand therefore f(ξ) = f(-ξ). Thus A is Hermitian, and because it is non-negative\ndefinite, 1 -|f(ξ)|2 ≥0. Therefore |f(ξ)| ≤1. Next, let ψ ∈S (RN; R), and use\nRiemann approximations to see that\nZZ\nf(ξ -η) ˆψ(ξ) ˆψ(η) dξdη ≥0.\nAssume for the moment that f is in L1(λRN ; C), and set\nh(x) = (2π)-N\nZ\ne-i(ξ,x)RN f(ξ) dξ.\nBy Parseval's identity, Fubini's Theorem and the fact that ˆψ(ξ) = ˆψ(-ξ),\n(2π)N\nZ\nh(x)ψ(x)2 dx =\nZ\nf(ξ)c\nψ2(-ξ) dξ =\nZ\nf(ξ) ˆψ ∗ˆψ(-ξ) dξ\n=\nZZ\nf(ξ) ˆψ(ξ + η) ˆψ(η) dξdη =\nZZ\nf(ξ -η) ˆψ(ξ) ˆψ(η) dξdη ≥0.\nHence, since h is continuous, it follows that h ≥0.

A μ ∈M1(RN) is said to be infinitely divisible in this ring if, for each\nn ≥1, there exists a μ 1\nn ∈M1(RN) such that\nμ = μ∗n\nn ≡μ 1\nn ∗· · · ∗μ 1\nn\n|\n{z\n}\nn times\n,\nand the set I(RN) of infinitely divisible measures is an important source of building\nblocks for constructions in probability theory.\nFor probabililists, an element of I(RN) is the distribution of a random variable\nwhich, for each n ≥1, can be written as the sum of n identically distributed random\nvariables. Using commutativity, it is easy to check that set I(RN) of infinitely\ndivisible measures is a subring of M1(RN).\nA famous theorem of L evy and A. Khinchine describes the characteristic function\nof every element of I(RN). Namely, μ ∈I(RN) if and only if\n(19.1)\nˆμ(ξ) = exp\nA\ni(b, ξ)RN -1\nξ, Aξ\nRN\n+\nZ\nei(ξ,y)RN -1 -i1B(0,1)(y)(ξ, y)RN\n\nM(dy)\na\n,\nfor some b ∈RN, non-negative definite, symmetric A ∈Hom(RN; RN), and Borel\nmeasure M on RN such that M({0}) = 0 and\nR\n|y|2\n1+|y|2 M(dy) < inf. The expression\nin (19.1) is called the L evy-Khinchine formula, a measure M satisfying the stated\nconditions is called a L evy measure, and the triple (b, A, M) is called a L evy system.\nIt is clear that if the right hand side of (19.1) is a characteristic function for every\nL evy system, then these are characteristic functions of infinitely divisible laws.\nIndeed, if μ corresponds to (b, A, M) and μ 1\nn corresponds to b\nn, A\nn , M\nn\n, then ˆμ =\n(\"\nμ 1\nn )n.\nProving that the function f(b,A,M) on the right hand side of (19.1) is a charac-\nteristic function is a relatively easy. To wit, f(0,I,0) = ˆγ, where γ is the standard\nGaussian measure on RN, and so it is easy to check that fb,A,0 is the characteristic\nfunction of the distribution of x ⇝b + A\n2 x under γ. Also, if the L evy measure M\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nis finite and πM is the Poisson measure given by\n(19.2)\nπM = e-M(RN)\ninf\nX\nn=0\nM ∗n\nn! ,\nthen\nd\nπM(ξ) = e-M(RN)\ninf\nX\nn=0\nˆ\nM(ξ)n\nn!\n= e-M(RN)+ ˆ\nM(ξ) = exp\nAZ eı(ξ,y)RN -1\na\nM(dy),\nand so d\nπM = f(bM,0,M), where bM =\nR\nB(0,1) y M(dy). Hence, when M is finite,\nf(b,A,M) is the characteristic function of γb-bM,A ∗πM. Finally, for general L evy\nmeasures M, set Mk(dy) = 1[ 1\nk ,inf)(|y|)M(dy). Then Mk is finite, and so f(b,A,Mk)\nis a characteristic function. Therefore, since f(b,A,Mk) -→f(b,A,M) uniformly on\ncompact subsets, Theorem 18.2 says that f(b,A,M) is a characteristic function.\nThere are no easy proofs that the characteristic function of any μ ∈I(RN) is\ngiven by (19.1). The first step is to show that if μ ∈I(RN), then there is a unique\nl∈C(RN; C) such that l(0) = 0,\n|l(ξ)|\n1+|ξ|2 is bounded, and ˆμ(ξ) = el(ξ). Showing\nthat lexists and is unique comes down to showing that ˆμ never vanishes. To do\nthat, choose r > 0 so that |1-ˆμ(ξ)| ≤1\n2 when |ξ| ≤r. Then there is an lfor which\nl(0) = 0, |l(ξ)| ≤2, and ˆμ(ξ) = el(ξ) if |ξ| ≤r. Using log z = -Pinf\nn=1\n(1-z)n\nn\nwhen\n|1 -z| < 1, one sees that |l(ξ)| ≤2 for |ξ| < r.\nSince \"\nμ 1\nn (ξ)n = ˆμ(ξ), \"\nμ 1\nn (ξ) = 0 when |ξ| ≤r, and so, by uniqueness, it must be\nthat ÷\nμ 1\nn (ξ) = e\nl(ξ)\nn\nfor |ξ| ≤r, and therefore |1 -\"\nμ 1\nn (ξ)| ≤2\nn when |ξ| ≤r. Hence,\nby (18.2), for any R > 0,\nμ 1\nn\n{y : |y| ≥R} ≤\n2N\nns(rN -1\n2 R)\n,\nand so\n|1-÷\nμ 1\nn (ξ)| ≤\nZ 1-eı(ξ,y) μ 1\nn (dy) ≤|ξ|R+2μ 1\nn\n{y : |y| ≥R} ≤|ξ|R+\n2N\nns(rN -1\n2 R)\n.\nGiven ξ = 0, take R =\n4|ξ|, choose n so that\n2N\nns(rN -1\n2 R) ≤1\n4, and conclude that\n|1 -\"\nμ 1\nn (ξ)| ≤1\n2 and therefore |ˆμ(ξ)| ≥2-n. This proves that ˆμ never vanishes\nand therefore that ˆμ = el. In addition, by using the fact that limt↘\ns(t)\nt2\n= 1\n6, the\npreceding line of reasoning shows that there is a C < infsuch that\n1 -e\nl(ξ)\nn ≤1\nwhen n ≥C|ξ|2, and therefore\n|l(ξ)|\n1+|ξ|2 is bounded.\nKnowing that \"\nμ 1\nn = e\nl\nn , one knows that\nl(ξ) = lim\nn→infn\"\nμ 1\nn (ξ) -1.\nThinking of las a tempered distribution, the challenge is to describe the distribution\nof which it is the Fourier transform. Thus, set u = ˇl.

If either A is non-degenerate or M(G) > 0 for all non-empty open\nsets G ⊆RN \\ {0}, then μ(b,A,M)(G) > 0 for all non-empty open sets G ⊆RN.\nProof. First observe that μ(b,A,M) = δb ∗μ(0,A,M), and therefore we can assume\nthat b = 0. Next note that μ(0,A,M) = γA ∗μ(0,0,M) where γA is the distribution\nof x ⇝A\n2 x under γ, and so, if A is non-degenerate and therefore γA has a strictly\npositive density, μ(0,A,M) does also.\nNow assume that b = 0, A = 0, and M(G) > 0 for all open ∅= G ⊆RN \\ {0}.\nGiven an open G = ∅, choose an η ∈CinfRN; [0, 1] which is strictly positive on G\nand vanishes off of G.

Hence, if f(t) = ⟨η, μ(0,0,tM)⟩, then f ≥0 and, by (19.3), μ(0,0,tM)(G) =\n0 =⇒f ′(t) > 0. But μ(0,0,tM)(G) = 0 also implies that f(t) = 0, which, by the\nfirst derivative test, is possible only if f ′(t) = 0. Hence f(t) > 0 for all t > 0, and\nso μ(0,0,M)(G) > 0.\n□\nTheorem 19.2. If N = 1, then μ(b,A,M)\n(-inf, 0) = 0 if and only if\n(19.4)\nA = 0, M(-inf, 0) = 0, and\nZ\n|y|<1\ny M(dy) ≤b.\nProof. Observe that, for n ≥1,\n{x ∈Rn : xj < 0 for 1 ≤j ≤n|} ⊆\n\nx ∈Rn :\nn\nX\nj=1\nxj < 0\n\n,\nand therefore μ 1\nn\n(-inf, 0)n ≤μ∗n(-inf, 0) for any μ ∈M1(R).\nNow assume that μ(b,A,M)\n(-inf, 0) = 0. Since μ(b,A,M) = γA ∗μ(b,0,M) and\nγA(G) > 0 for all open G = ∅unless A = 0, it follows that A = 0. Next observe\nthat f(b,0,M) has a bounded analytic extension to {ζ ∈C : Reζ < 0}, and there-\nfore M(-inf, 0) must be 0. Finally, to prove the inequality in (19.4), set μ 1\nn =\nμ( b\nn ,0, M\nn ). Since μ1 = μ∗n\nn , the observation above shows that μ 1\nn\n(-inf, 0) = 0, and\ntherefore, if φ ≥0 on [0, inf) and φ(0) = 0, then, by (19.3),\nL(b,0,M)φ(0) = lim\nn→infn⟨φ, μ 1\nn ⟩-φ(0) ≥0,\nand so\nbφ′(0) +\nZ φ(y) -1(-1,1)(y)yφ′(0) M(dy) ≥0.\n\nTOPICS IN FOURIER ANALYSIS\nNow choose η ∈CinfR; [0, 1] so that η = 1 on -1\n2, 1\nand η = 0 off (-1, 1), and,\nfor r ∈(0, 1), set φr(x) = yηr(y) where ηr(y) = η y\nr\n.

Then (19.4) holds for (b, 0, Mr) and (cf.

Singular Integral Operators\nThe classic Poisson problem is that of finding, for a given a function φ, a solution\nu to the equation ∆u = -φ in RN, and one of the questions that arises is determin-\ning how properties of the function φ are reflected by the solution u. In particular,\none wants to know whether second order derivatives of u can be estimated in terms\nof φ. When N = 1, this problem doesn't arise because -φ is the second derivative\nof u. However, when N ≥2, it is not at all clear to what extent the entire Hessian\nmatrix of u is controlled by its trace.\nTo address this question, it is best to begin by giving an integral representation\nof the solution u. Depending on dimension, u is given by\nu(x) =\nZ\nG(N)\n(x -y)φ(y) dy,\nwhere G(N)\nis the (cf. § 16) Green's function for the Laplacian in RN:\nG(N)\n(x) =\n(r) 1\nπ log |x|\nif N = 2\n(N-2)ωN-1|x|N-2\nif N ≥3.\nThus\n∂xi∂xju(x) =\nZ\nG(N)\ni,j (x -y)φ(y) dy\nwhere\n(20.1)\nG(N)\ni,j (x) =\nωN-1|x|N\nZ A\n-δi,j + N xixj\n|x|2\na\n.\n\nDANIEL W. STROOCK\nBecause G(N)\ni,j\nis not an integrable function, one has take care when interpreting\nconvolution with it. On the other hand, since G(N)\n∈S (RN; C)\n∗, so is is G(N)\ni,j , and\ntherefore φ ∗G(N)\ni,j\nmakes perfectly good sense when φ ∈S (RN; C). The question\nthen is whether, using this interpretation, one can derive estimates.\nBefore getting into the details, it is important to know what sort of estimates are\npossible. In particular, because G(N)\ni,j\nis neither integrable nor bounded, one should\nnot expect that convolution with it will map either L1(λRN ; C) or Linf(λRN ; C) into\nitself. Even so, it turns out (cf. (24.2) below) that it maps Lp(λRN ; C) boundedly\ninto itself when p ∈(1, inf), and what follows is one way to prove that.\n21. The Hilbert Transform\nA key fact about G(N)\ni,j\nis that it is a Borel measurable, homogeneous function of\norder N whose integral over SN-1 is 0. That is, it is a function of the form\nk(x) = Ω(x)\n|x|N\nwhere Ω↾SN-1 ∈L1(λSN-1; C) satisfies Ω(rx) = Ω(x) for all r > 0 and\nZ\nSN-1 Ω(ω) λSN-1(dω) = 0.\nA Calder`on-Zygmund kernel k determines a tempered distribution by the prescrip-\ntion\n⟨φ, k⟩= lim\nr↘0\nZ\n|y|≥r\nφ(y) k(y) dy\n= lim\nr↘0\nZ\n|y|≥r\nφ(y) -φ(0)1[-1,1](y) k(y) dy =\nZ φ(y) -φ(0)1[-1,1](y) k(y) dy.\nSuch functions k are called Calder`on-Zygmund kernels because Calder`on and\nZygmund were able to prove a large number of deep results about convolution\nwith respect to them. In particular (cf. (23.2) below), they showed that, in great\ngenerality, for each p ∈(1, inf) there is a constant Cp, depending on N and Ω, such\nthat ∥φ ∗k∥Lp(λRN ;C) ≤Cp∥φ∥Lp(λRN ;C).\nWhen N = 1 there is, up to a multiple constant, only one C-K kernel, namely, the\nfunction h(x) =\nπx. Convolution with respect to h was studied originally by Hilbert\nand has been known as the Hilbert transform ever since. A seminal observation\nmade by Hilbert is that, even though h /∈L1(λR; C), this transform is a bounded\nmapping of L2(λR; C) into itself. Indeed, thinking of h as a tempered distribution,\nwe showed in (6.2) that ˆh(ξ) = ısgn(ξ). Thus, we know that ∥φ ∗h∥L2(λR;C) ≤\n∥φ∥L2(λR;C).\nIn order to prove the estimate for p = 2, I will use an beautiful approach that\nI think was introduced by M. Riesz and is closely related to the ideas we used\nto compute ˆh.\nRecall the functions py(x) =\nπ\ny\nx2+y2 and qy =\nπ\nx\nx2+y2 which\nare, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of\nı\nz when z = x + ıy. Next, set\nhy(x) = 1[y,inf)(x)h(x), and observe that ∥hy -qy∥L1(λR;C) = ∥h1 -q1∥L1(λR;C) ≤\nπ, and therefore ∥φ ∗hy -φ ∗qy∥Lp(λR;C) ≤\nπ∥φ∥Lp(λR;C).

Clearly, if θ ∈-π\n8n, π\n8n\n∪ 7π\n8 , 9π\n, An can be chosen so the An cos 2nθ\ndominates cos2n θ; and for θ not in those intervals, Bn can be chosen so that\nBn sin2n θ dominates cos2n θ -An cos 2nθ.\nWith the preceding at hand, we know that\nZ φ ∗qy(x)2n dx ≤AnRe\nAZ\nf(x + ıy)2n dx\na\ndx + Bn\nZ φ ∗py(x)2n dx.\nWhat Riesz saw is that he could use Cauchy's theorem to prove that the integral\nof x ⇝f(x + ıy)2n is independent of y > 0. Indeed, consider the rectangle {z =\nx + ıy : |x| ≤R & y1 ≤y ≤y2}. Cauchy's theorem says that the contour integral\nof f 2n around the boundary is 0. In addition, since φ ∈S (R2; C), as R →inf\nthe contribution to the integral from the vertical parts of the boundary tends to\n0, and so the integrals over the horizontal parts are equal.

Interpolation\nAlthough (21.1) is already significant, one should suspect that a similar estimate\nholds for all p ∈(0, inf), not just even integers. However, because Riesz needed f p\nto be an analytic function, he needed p to be an integer; and because he needed\n(Ref)p to be non-negative, he needed it to be an even integer. It was to overcome\nthis problem that he proved a powerful general result, known as an interpolation\ntheorem, that can be viewed as an operator theoretic analog of H older's equality.\nThe following version and proof of his result is due to G.

STROOCK\n23. The Method of Rotations\nCalder`on and Zygmund noticed that the Hilbert transform, and especially (22.1),\ncan be used to prove the Lp boundedness of their kernels when Ω∈L1(λSN-1; C) is\nodd (i.e., Ω(-ω) = -Ω(ω) for ω ∈SN-1). For example, set ky(x) = 1[y,inf)(|x|)k(x)\nfor (x, y) ∈RN × (0, inf). Then because\nc\nky(ξ) = lim\nR→inf\nZ\ny<|x|≤R\neı(ξ,x)k(x) dx\n= lim\nR→inf\nZ\nSN-1 Ω(ω)\nCZ\n(y,R]\neır(ξ,ω) 1\nr dr\na\nλSN-1dω,\nif Ωis odd, one has that\nc\nky(ξ) = lim\nR→inf\nZ\nSN-1 Ω(ω)\nCZ\ny<|r|≤R\neır(ξ,ω) 1\nr dr\na\nλSN-1(dω)\n= π\nZ\nSN-1 Ω(ω)c\nhy\n(ξ, ω) λSN-1(dω).\nHence,\n(23.1)\nc\nky(ξ) = ıπ\nZ\nSN-1 Ω(ω)c\nhy\n(ξ, ω) λSN-1(dω),\nand so\n∥c\nky∥u ≤\nπ∥Ω∥L1(λSN-1;C)∥c\nhy∥u\n.\nIn particular, we already know that\n∥φ ∗k∥L2(λRN ;C) ≤\nπ∥Ω∥L1(λSN-1;C)\n∥φ∥L2(λRN ;C).\nThe same trick as we just used allows us to prove estimates for general p ∈(1, inf).\nNamely, again using the oddness of k, one can first write\nφ ∗ky(x) = 1\nZ\nSN-1 Ω(ω)\nCZ\n|r|>y\nφ(x -rω)dr\nr\na\nλSN-1(dω),\nand then, after applying Minkowski's inequality,\n∥φ ∗kε∥Lp(λRN ;C) ≤1\nZ\nSN-1 |Ω(ω)|\nZ\nRN\n\nZ\n|r|>y\nφ(x -rω) dr\nr\n\np\ndx\n! 1\np\nλSN-1(dω).\nFinally, for fixed e ∈SN-1, choose Euclidean coordinates for RN so that e points\nin the direction of the first coordinate.

The Riesz Kernels\nIn a sense which can be made very precise, the basic C-Z kernels for RN are the\nRiesz kernels ri(x) = cN\nxi\n|x|N+1 , 1 ≤i ≤N, where\ncN ≡\nAπ\nZ\nSN-1 |ω1| λSN-1(dω)\na-1\n.\nObviously, the preceding applies to each of these.\nTo get a feeling for how\nconvolution with respect to ri acts, apply (23.1) to see that\n\"ri(ξ) = ıπcN\nZ\nSN-1 ωisgn(ξ, ω) λSN-1(dω).\nCertainly, \"ri is homogeneous of degree 0, and so we need only worry about ξ ∈SN-1.\nGiven ξ ∈SN-1, write ω = (ω, ξ)ξ + ω⊥ξ. Then\nZ\nSN-1ωisgn(ξ, ω) λSN-1(dω)\n= ξi\nZ\nSN-1 |(ω, ξ)| λSN-1(dω) +\nZ\nSN-1\nω⊥ξ\nisgn(ξ, ω) λSN-1(dω).\nBecause the integrand in the second term is an odd function of ω ⇝(ξ, ω), the\nsecond term vanishes. Hence,\n(24.1)\n\"ri(ξ) = ıξi\n|ξ|,\nξ ∈RN \\ {0}.\nTo evaluate cN, observe that c1 = 1\nπ is trivial. When N ≥2, use\nZ\nSN-1|ω1| λSN-1(dω) = ωN-2\nZ\n(-1,1)\n|ρ|1 -ρ2 N-3\ndρ\n= ωN-2\nZ\n(0,1)\n(1 -t)\nN-3\ndt = 2ωN-2\nN -1 = 2ΩN-1,\nwhere ΩN-1 is the volume to the unit ball in RN-1, and so cN =\nπΩN-1 .\nFrom the Riesz transforms one can build other kernels. For instance, recall the\nkernels in (20.1). Because ∂xi∂xjφ = -(∆φ) ∗G(N)\ni,j , -ξiξj ˆφ = |ξ|2'\nG(N)\ni,j ˆφ, and so\n'\nG(N)\ni,j (ξ) = -ξiξj\n|ξ|2 = -\"ri(ξ)\"\nrj(ξ).\nHence, φ ∗G(N)\ni,j\n= -(φ ∗ri) ∗rj, and so\n(24.2)\n∥φ ∗G(N)\ni,j ∥Lp(λRN ;C) ≤K2\np∥φ∥Lp(λRN ;C) for p ∈(1, inf).\nEquivalently, we now know that\n∥∂xi∂xjφ∥Lp(λRN ;C) ≤K2\np∥∆φ∥Lp(λRN ;C) for p ∈(1, inf).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nRES.18-015 Topics in Fourier Analysis\nSpring 2024\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Basic Theory of Fourier Series\nSet em(x) = eı2πmx for m ∈Z and x ∈R, and observe that {em : m ∈Z} is an\northonormal family in L2(λ[0,1); C).1 Even though it involves an abuse of notation,\nwe will use (φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) to denote\nR\n[0,1) φ(y)e-m(y) dy for φ ∈L1(λ[0,1); C).\nGiven a function φ : [0, 1) -→C, define its periodic extension φ : R -→C\nby φ(x) = φx -⌊x⌋, where ⌊x⌋= max{n ∈Z : x ≥n}. Notice that if φ ∈\nL1(λ[0,1); C), then\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(x) dx =\nZ\n[a,a+1)\nφ(x) dx for all a ∈R.\nSimilarly,\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(-x) dx =\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(x) dx.\nFor bounded, continuous functions φ and ψ on [0, 1), define\nφ ∗ψ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1)\nφ(x -y)ψ(y) dy,\nand use the preceding to check that\nφ ∗ψ(x) =\nZ\n[-x,-x+1]\nφ(y) ψ(x -y) dy = ψ ∗φ(x).\nFinally, by the continuous version of Minkowski's inequality,2\n∥φ ∗ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C) ≤∥φ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C)∥ψ∥L1(λ[0,1);C) ∧∥ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C)∥φ∥L1(λ[0,1);C)\nfor any p ∈[1, inf).\nHence, for each p ∈[1, inf), (φ, ψ) ⇝φ ∗ψ has a unique\ncontinuous extension as a map bilinear map from L1(λ[0,1); C) × Lp(λ[0,1); C) into\nLp(λ[0,1); C), and\n(1.1)\n∥φ ∗ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C) ≤∥φ∥L1(λ[0,1);C)∥ψ∥Lp(λ[0,1);C)\ncontinues to hold.\nTheorem 1.1.

Define\npr(x) =\nX\nm∈Z\nr|m|em(x) for r ∈[0, 1) and x ∈[0, 1).\n1For a measure space (E, F, μ) and p ∈[1, inf], Lp(μ; C) is the associated Lebesgue space. For\na Borel measurable subset S ⊆RN, λS is the Lebesgue's measure resticted to S.\n2If φ ∈Lp(μ; C), then ∥φ∥Lp(μ;C) is its Lp-norm.\n3∥· ∥u is the uniform (i.e., supremum norm).\n\nClearly\nR 1\n0 pr(x) dx = 1, pr(-x) = pr(x), and epr is continuous. In addition,\npr(x) =\n1 -re1(x)+\nre-1(x)\n1 -re-1(x) =\n1 -r2\n|1 -re1(x)|2 =\n1 -r2\n1 -2r cos 2πx + r2 for r ∈[0, 1),\nand so pr ≥0.\nObviously,\nX\nm∈Z\nr|m|φ, em\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C)em(x) = pr ∗φ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1)\npr(y) φ(x + y) dy\nsince pr is even. Now suppose that φ ∈C[0, 1] : C with φ(0) = φ(1). Then, since\nlimr↗1\nR 1\nδ pr(y) dy = 0 for each δ ∈(0, 1), it is easy to check that\nlim\nr↗1 sup\nx∈[0,1]\n\nZ 1\nφ(x + y) dy -f(x)\n≤ωφ(δ),\nwhere ωφ is the modulus of continuity of φ. Thus the second part of the theorem\nhas been proved.\nTo prove the first part, let φ ∈Lp(λ[0,1); C), and choose choose a sequence {φk :\nk ≥1} ⊆C[0, 1]; C which satisfy φk(0) = φk(1) and ∥φ -φk∥Lp(λ[0,1];C) -→0 as\nk →inf.

It suffices to check the first statement, and to do so all we need to know is\nthat (φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) = 0 for all m ∈Z implies φ = 0 for a set of φ's which is dense\nin L2(λ[0,1); C). But, by Theorem 1.1, we know this for continuous φ's satisfying\nφ(0) = φ(1), and these are dense in L2(λ[0,1); C).\n□\nEquation (1.2) is known as Parseval's identity for Fourier series.\nDefine the partial sum Snφ = P\n|m|≤n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)em.\nCorollary 1.3. If φ ∈C([0, 1]; C) and\nX\nm=0\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)\n< inf,\n\nthen the series\nX\nm∈Z\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)em(x)\nis uniformly absolutely convergent to φ. In fact,\nSn(φ) -φ\n\nu ≤\nX\n|m|>n\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C)\n.\nProof. That the series if uniformly absolutely convergent is obvious. To see that\nit must be converging to φ, let ψ be uniform limit of {Snφ : n ≥0}. Then ψ is\ncontinuous and, because φ is the L2(λ[0,1); C) limit of this series, ψ = φ λ[0,1]-almost\neverywhere, which, since both are continues, means that they are equal everywhere.\nGiven these statements, the final estimate is trivial.\n□\nLemma 1.4. Let l≥1 and assume that φ ∈Cl([0, 1]; C) satisfies φ(k)(0) = φ(k)(1)\nfor 0 ≤k ≤l-1. Then\n(φ, em)L2(λ[0,1);C) =\n\nı\n2πm\nlφ(l), em\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C) for m = 0.\nProof.

First observe that, for l≥1,\nBl, e0\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) = -\nZ 1\nB′\nl+1(x) dx = Bl+1(0) -Bl+1(1) = 0\nand, for l≥2 and n = 0,\nBl, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\nı\n2πn\nBl-1, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C)\nand therefore\nA2πn\nı\nal-1 Bl, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) = B1, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\nZ 1\n2 -xe-n(x) dx = -ı\n2πn.\n\nHence\nBl, en\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\n-ıl\n(2πn)l\nfor l≥2 and n = 0, which completes the proof of (3.3). Finally, because bl= Bl(0),\nit is clear from (3.3) that b2l+1 = 0 and that (3.4) holds.\n□\nBesides (3.4), the Bernoulli polynomials play a critical role in what is known as\nthe Euler-Maclauren formula:\n(3.5)\nZ n\nf(x) dx -\nn\nX\nm=1\nf(m)\n= -\nl\nX\nk=1\nbk\nf (k-1)(n) -f k-1(0) +\nZ n\nBl(x)f (l)(x) dx\nfor l≥1,\nwhere Blis the periodic extension of Bl↾[0, 1) to R. To prove (3.5), first note that\nZ n\nf(x) dx -\nn\nX\nm=1\nf(m) =\nn\nX\nm=1\nZ m\nm-1\nf(x) -f(m) dx\n= -\nn\nX\nm=1\nZ m\nm-1\nx -(m -1)f ′(x) dx\n=\nn\nX\nm=1\nA\n-b1\nf(m) -f(m -1) +\nZ m\nm-1\nB1\nx -(m -1)f ′(x) dx\na\n= -b1\nf(n) -f(0) +\nZ n\nB1(x)f ′(x) dx.\nHence, (3.5) holds when l= 1. Next observe that for any l≥1,\nZ n\nBl(x) = n\nZ 1\nBl(x) dx = nBl+1(1) -Bl+1(0) = 0,\nand therefore\nZ n\nBl(x)f (l)(x) dx =\nn\nX\nm=1\nZ m\nm-1\nBl\nx -(m -1)f (l)(x) -f (l)(m) dx\n=\nn\nX\nm=1\nA\n-bl+1\nf (l)(m) -f (l)(m -1) +\nZ m\nm-1\nBl+1\nx -(m -1)f (l+1)(x) dx\na\n= -bl+1\nf (l)(n) -f(0) +\nZ n\nBl+1(x)f (l+1)(x) dx.\nTherefore, (3.5) for limplies (3.5) for l+ 1.\nTheorem 3.3. If l≥1 and φ ∈Cl[0, 1]; C, then\n(3.6)\nZ 1\nφ(x) -1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nφ m\nn\n\n= -\nl\nX\nk=1\nbk\nnk\nφ(k-1)(1) -φ(k-1)(0) + 1\nnl\nZ 1\nBl(nx)φ(l)(x) dx,\n.\n\nProof. Take f(x) = φ x\nn\n, apply (3.5) to f, and make a simple change of variables.\n□\nBy Schwarz's inequality,\n\nZ 1\nBl(nx)φ(l)(x) dx\n≤\nCZ 1\nBl(nx)2 dx\na 1\n∥φ(l)∥L2(λ[0,1];C),\nand\nZ 1\nBl(nx)2 dx = 1\nn\nZ n\nBl(x)2 dx = ∥Bl∥2\nL2(λR;C).\nFurther, by (1.2) and (3.3),\n∥Bl∥2\nL2(λR;C) =\n(2π)2l\nX\nn=0\nn2l.\nHence, by (3.6),\n(3.7)\n\nZ 1\nφ(x) dx -1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nφ m\nn\n+\nl\nX\nk=1\nbk\nnk\nφ(k-1)(1) -φ(k-1)(0)\n\n≤\np\n2ζ(2l)\n(2πn)l∥φ(l)∥L2(λ[0,1];C).\nFrom (3.7) one sees that if, for some n ≥1,\n(3.8)\nlim\nl→inf\n∥φ(l)∥L2(λ[0,1];C)\n(2πn)l\n= 0,\nthen\nZ 1\nφ(x) dx -1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nφ m\nn\n= -lim\nl→inf\nl\nX\nk=1\nbk\nnk\nφ(k-1)(1) -φ(k-1)(0).\nIn particular, if φ ∈Cinf[0, 1]; C and φ(k) is periodic for all k ≥0, then (3.8)\nimplies that\nZ 1\nφ(x) dx = 1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nφ m\nn\n,\na result that has a much simpler derivation (cf.

Comparing Summability Methods\nIn preparation for the following section, we will review here basic definitions and\nresults for different notions of convergence of a series.\nGiven a sequence {am : m ≥1} ⊆C, set\nSn =\nn\nX\nm=1\nam and An = 1\nn\nn\nX\nm=1\nSm,\nand when limn→inf|am|\nm ≤1, set\nA(r) =\ninf\nX\nm=1\namrm-1 for r ∈[0, 1).\nThe Sn's are called the partial sums of the corresponding series, the An's are its\nC esaro means, and r ⇝A(r) is its Abel function.

      "content": "5. Some Refinements\nIn this section we will apply the notions of summability discussed in the previous\nsection to Fourier series. Observe that we have already considered Abel summability\nin §1.\nTo examine further when the series is summable, introduce the function\nDn(x) =\nX\n|m|≤n\nem(x) for x ∈R.\nThen Dn, which is often called the Dirichlet kernel, is an even, periodic function\nwith period 1,\nR 1\n0 Dn(x) dx = 1, and Snφ = Dn ∗φ. In addition\nDn(x) = e-n(x)\n2n\nX\nm=0\nem(x) = e-n(x)1 -e2n+1(x)\n1 -e1(x)\n= e-ıπ(2n+1)x -eıπ(2n+1)x\ne-ıπx -eıπx\n= sin π(2n + 1)x\nsin πx\n.\nHence,\nSnφ(x) -φ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1]\nφ(x + y) -φ(x)\nsin πy\nsin π(2n + 1)y dy.\nNow suppose that φ is an R-valued function for which φ(0) = φ(1), and assume\nthat φ ∈Cα[0, 1]; C) 1 is H older continuous of order α ∈(0, 1). Set\nψ(y) = eıπy φ(x + y) -φ(x)\nsin πy\n.\nThen ψ ∈L1(λ[0,1); C) and Snφ(x) -φ(x) is the imaginary part of\nZ\n[0,1]\nψ(y)e-2n+1(y) dt = ψ, e2n-1\n\nL2(λ[0,1);C),\nand so, by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma (cf. Exercise 1.1), Snφ(x) -→φ(x) as\nn →inf. The preceding shows that if φ ∈Cα[0, 1]; C satisfies φ(0) = φ(1), then\nSnφ -→φ pointwise, but it does not provide a rate of convergence or even say if\nthe convergence is uniform.\nC esaro summability of Fourier series was initiated by Fej er. Obviously,\nn\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nSmφ = Fn ∗φ,\nwhere\nFn(x) ≡1\nn\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nDn(x).\nThe function Fn is called the Fej er kernel, and it is clear that Fn is a continuous,\neven function of period 1 for which\nR\n[0,1] Fn(x) dx = 1. In addition, nFn(x) sin πx\nis the imaginary part of\neıπx\nn-1\nX\nm=0\ne2m(x) = eıπx 1 -eıπ2nx\n1 -eı2πx = ı(1 -eı2πnx)\n2 sin πx\n,\n1Cα(E; C) space of C-valued functions on a metric space E which are uniformly H older con-\ntinuous of order α ∈(0, 1).\n\nand so\n(5.1)\nFn(x) = 1 -cos 2πnx\n2n sin2 πx\n= 1\nn\nAsin πnx\nsin πx\na2\n.\nProceeding as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, one sees that\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x) =\nZ\n[0,1]\nFn(y) φ(x + y) -φ(x) dx -→0\nuniformly if φ is continuous and satisfies φ(1) = φ(0). Equivalently,\nlim\nn→inf\n\nn\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nSmφ -φ\n\nu\n= 0.\nIt turns out that one can do much better.\nTheorem 5.1. Let φ : [-1\n2, 1\n2] -→C be a measurable function, let x ∈-1\n2, 1\n, and\nassume that there is a C ∈(0, inf) and α ∈(0, 1] such that | φ(x+y)-φ(x)| ≤C|y|α\nfor y ∈-1\n2, 1\n. For n ≥5\n(5.2)\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤C\n(\n(1+α)nα + 4(n1-α-41-α)\nπ2(1-α)n\n+ 1-2-(1+α)\n2α(1+α)n\nif α ∈(0, 1)\n16n +\n4 log n\nπ2n(1-α)\nif α = 1.\nHence\nlim\nn→infnα|Fn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤\n1 + α +\nπ2(1 -α)\nif α ∈(0, 1)\nand\nlim\nn→inf\nn\nlog n|Fn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤4\nπ2\nif α = 1.\nProof. Without loss in generality, I will assume that C = 1.\nThe proof turns on the estimates\n(5.3)\nFn(y) ≤\n\nn\nfor all y ∈-1\n2, 1\n\nπ2ny2\nwhen |y| ∈0, 1\n\nn\nwhen |y| ∈ 1\n4, 1\n\nThat Fn(y) ≤n is clear from the fact that ∥Dm∥u ≤1 and therefore that nFn(y) ≤\n2 Pn-1\nm=1 m + n = n2.\nTo see second inequality, note that cos πt ≥2-1\n2 when\n|y| ∈0, 1\nand therefore that\n| sin πy| =\nZ π|y|\ncos t dt ≥2-1\n2 π|y|.\nAs for Fn(y) ≤2\nn when |y| ∈ 1\n4, 1\n, simply remember that | sin πy| ≥2-1\n2 for such\ny's.\n\nAssume that α ∈(0, 1). Because\nR 1\n-1\n2 Fn(y) = 1\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤\nZ\n-1\nFn(y)\nφ(x + y) -φ(x)\ndy\n≤n\nZ\nn\n|y|α dy +\nπ2n\nZ\nn\n|y|α-2 dy + 2\nn\nZ\n4 ≤|y|≤1\n|y|α dy\n≤\n(1 + α)nα + 4(n1-α -41-α)\nπ2(1 -α)n\n+ 1 -2-(1+α)\n2α(1 + α)n .\nIf α = 1, the top line in (5.2) holds for all α ∈(0, 1), and therefore one need\nonly examine what happens as α ↗1. Clearly\n(1+α)nα ↘1\nn and 1-2-(1+α)\n2α(1+α)n ↘\n16n\nas α ↗1. To handle the remaining term, note that it can be written as\n42-α\nπ2n\nn\n1-α -1\n1 -α\nwhich decreases to 4 log n\nπ2n\nas α ↗1.\n□\nOne could of course have derived the estimate when α = 1 directly by the same\nargument as was used when α < 1. However, the derivation given has the advantage\nthat it shows the estimates get stronger for all n ≥5, not just asymptotically, as α\nincreases.\nObviously, results like those in Theorem 5.1 turn on the continuity properties of\nφ, properties that a generic element of L1(λ[0,1); C) will not possess. Nonetheless,\nLebesgue showed that every locally λR-integrable φ does have a continuity property\nat almost everywhere point. Namely, he showed that\nlim\nr↘0\nr\nZ r\n| φ(x ± t) -φ(x)| dt = 0\nfor λR-almost every x ∈R,\nand he used this fact to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.2. If φ ∈ L1λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C, then\nlim\nn→infFn ∗φ(x) = φ(x) for λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]-almost every x ∈[0, 1].\nProof. Set φx(y) = | φ(x + y) -φ(x)| and\nΦx(y) = 1\n|y|\nZ |y|\nφx(sgn(y)t) dt.\nBy Lebesgue's theorem, lim|y|↘0 Φx(y) = 0 for λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]-almost every x ∈-1\n2, 1\n.\nLet x be such a point. Then\nFn ∗φ(x) -φ(x)\n≤\nZ 0\n-1\nFn(y)φx(y) dy +\nZ\nFn(y)φx(y) dy.\nWe will show only that limn→inf\nR 1\n0 Fn(y)φx(y) dy = 0 because the proof that\nlimn→inf\nR 0\n-1\n2 Fn(y)φx(y) dy = 0 is essentially the same.\n\nUsing our estimates for Fn in (5.3), one has\nZ\nFn(y)φx(y) dy =\nZ\nn\nFn(y)φx(y) dy +\nZ\nn\nFn(y)φx(y) dy\n≤n\nZ\nn\nφx(y) dy + 2\nn\nZ\nn\nφx(y)\ny2\ndy.\nSince\nn\nZ\nn\nφx(y) dy = Φx\nn\n,\nthe first term tends to 0. As for the second, use integration by parts to see that it\nis dominated by\n4Φx\n\nn\n+ 4\nn\nZ\nn\nΦx(y)\ny2\ndy.\nFinally, given ε > 0, choose δ ∈0, 1\nso that Φx(y) ≤ε for 0 ≤y ≤δ. Then, for\nn > 1\nδ ,\nn\nZ\nn\nΦx(y)\ny2\ndy ≤ε\nn\nZ δ\nn\ny2 dy + 1\nn\nZ\nδ\nΦx(y)\ny2\ndy ≤2ε + ∥Φx∥u\nδn\n,\nand so\nlim\nn→inf\nZ\nFn(y)φx(y) dy ≤4ε.\n□\nTheorem 5.2 is a stark contrast to a famous example produced in 1926 by Kol-\nmogorov2 of a function in L1λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C for which {Snφ(x) : n ≥0} diverges\nat every x. It is also interesting to compare it to more recent results by L. Car-\nleson and R. Hunt.\nNamely, Carleson showed that Snφ -→φ (a.e.,λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]) if\nφ ∈L2λ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C, and Hunt showed that the same is true for φ ∈Lpλ[-1\n2 , 1\n2 ]; C\nfor p ∈(1, inf).\nExercise 5.1. Show that\nlim\nn→inf\nnα\nZ\n-1\nFn(y)|y|α dy > 0 for α ∈(0, 1)\nand that\nlim\nn→inf\nn\nlog n\nZ\n-1\nFn(y)|y| dy > 0.\nHence the rates given Theorem 5.1 are optimal.\nHint: If 0 ≤m ≤n -1, show that\nFn(y) ≥\n2π2ny2 if 4m + 1\nn4\n≤y ≤2m + 1\n2n\n.\n2A.N.

Hence, for any ζ ∈C, integration by parts leads to\n∂t\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx = 1\nZ\neζx∂2\nxgt(x) dx = ζ2\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx.\nSince\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx =\nZ\net\n2 ζxg1(x) dx -→1\nas t ↘0,\nZ\neζxgt(x) dx = e\ntζ2\n2 .\nIn particular\n(7.3)\n\"\ngt(ξ) = e-ξ2\nEquivalently, \"\ngt = 2π\nt\n2 g 1\nt and so\n(7.4)\nbgt)∧= 2πgt.\nSet py(x) = 1\nπ\ny\nx2+y2 for (y, x) ∈(0, inf) × R, and note that\nZ\npy(x) dx =\nZ\np1(x) dx = 1 for all y > 0.\nIn addition, because py(x) is the real part of\nı\nπz with z = x + ıy, (x, y) ⇝py(x) is\nharmonic. Thus, ∂2\nxpy = -∂2\nypy, and so, by (7.2),\n∂2\ny \"\npy(ξ) = ξ2 \"\npy(ξ).\nThus, for each ξ,\n'\npy(ξ) = a(ξ)eyξ + b(ξ)e-yξ,\n\nwhere, since \"\npy(0) = 1, a(ξ) + b(ξ) = 1. Because |'\npy(ξ)| ≤1, ξ ≥0 =⇒a(ξ) =\n0 & b(ξ) = 1 and ξ < 0 =⇒a(ξ) = 1 & b(ξ) = 0. Hence\n(7.5)\n\"\npy(ξ) = e-y|ξ|.\nHere is an interesting application of equations (7.3) and (7.5). Since\nξ2 + y2 =\nZ inf\ne-t(ξ2+y2) dx =\nZ inf\ne-ty2\"\ng2t(ξ) dt\nand \"\ng2t\n∧= 2πg2t,\nπ\ny e-y|x| = 2π\nZ inf\ne-ty2g2t(x) dt = π\nZ inf\nt-1\n2 e-ty2e-x2\n4t dt.\nThus, for x, y ∈(0, inf),\n(7.6)\nZ inf\nt-1\n2 e-ty2e-x2\nt dt = π\n2 e-2yx\ny\n,\na computation which can also be done using a somewhat tricky change of variables.\nTheorem 7.2. (Poisson Sum) Let f ∈L1(λR; C) ∩C(R; C), and assume that\nX\nn∈Z\nC\nsup\nx∈[0,1]\n|f(x + n)| + | ˆf(2πn)|\na\n< inf.\nThen\n(7.7)\nX\nn∈Z\nf(n) =\nX\nn∈Z\nˆf(2πn).\nProof. Define f(x) = P\nn∈Z f(x + n). Then f is a continuous periodic function\nwith period 1, and\nf, em\n\nL2(λ[0,1];C) =\nX\nn∈Z\nZ 1\ne-ı2πmxf(x + n) dx =\nZ\ne-ı2πmxf(x) dx = ˆf(-2πm).\nThus, P\nm∈Z\n( f, em)L2(λ[0,1];C)\n< inf, and therefore\nf(x) =\nX\nm∈Z\nˆf(-2πm)em(x) =\nX\nm∈Z\nˆf(2πm)e-m(x),\nwhere the convergence of the series is absolute and uniform. By taking x = 0, (7.7)\nfollows.\n□\nEquation (7.7) is known as the Poisson summation formula. Among its many\napplications is the following.\nWhen f = py, (7.7) says that\ny\nπ\nX\nn∈Z\ny2 + n2 =\nX\nn∈Z\ne-2πy|n| = 1 + e-2πy\n1 -e-2πy = coth πy,\nand so\n(7.8)\nX\nn∈Z\ny2 + n2 = π coth πy\ny\nfor y > 0.\n\nA famous application of (7.8) is Euler's product formula:\n(7.9)\nsin πx = πx\ninf\nY\nm=1\nA\n1 -x2\nm2\na\n.\nTo prove it, first observe that\nx2 + m2 = 1\n2x∂x logx2 + m2 = 1\n2x∂x log\nA\n1 + x2\nm2\na\nfor m = 0\nand that π coth πy = ∂y log(sinh πy). Hence, by (7.8)\nx∂x log\ninf\nY\nn=1\nA\n1 + x2\nn2\na\n+ 1\nx2 = 1\nx∂x log(sinh πx),\nwhich means that\n∂x log\ninf\nY\nn=1\nA\n1 + x2\nn2\na\n= ∂x log(x-1 sinh πx).\nIntegrating both sides from 0 to x, one gets\nlog x\ninf\nY\nn=1\nA\n1 + x2\nn2\na\n= log(sinh πx) -log π = log sinh πx\nπx\n,\nwhich means that\n(7.10)\nsinh πx = πx\ninf\nY\nn=1\nA\n1 + x2\nn2\na\nfrom which (7.9) follows by analytic continuation.\nAnother application of (7.5) is a proof1 that\n(7.11)\nlim\nR→inf\nZ R\n-R\nsin ξx\nx\ndx = sgn(ξ)π\nfor ξ = 0.\nWe begin with the more or less trivial observation that\nZ R\n-R\nsin ξx\nx\ndx = sgn(ξ)\nZ R\n-R\nsin |ξ|x\nx\ndx = sgn(ξ)\nZ |ξ|R\n-|ξ|R\nsin x\nx\ndx.\nThus, what we have to show is that\nlim\nR→inf\nZ R\n-R\nsin x\nx\ndx = π.\n(∗)\nThe first step in the proof (∗), is to show that if\ngR(ξ, y) ≡\nZ R\n-R\nx sin ξx\nx2 + y2 dx -→πe-yξ\nfor ξ > 0,\n(∗∗)\nthen (∗) holds. Indeed,\n\nZ R\n-R\nsin ξx\nx\ndx -gR(ξ, y)\n≤2y2\n\nZ inf\n| sin ξx|\nx(x2 + y2) dx\na\n≤ξπy,\nand so (∗∗) implies (∗).\n1The most commonly given proof is based on contour integration and Cauchy's theorem.\n\nThe next step is to show that for each y > 0 there exists a continuous ξ ∈\n(0, inf) 7-→g(ξ, y) ∈C such that gR(ξ, y) -→g(ξ, y) uniformly for ξ compact\nsubsets of (0, inf). To this end, note that\ngR(ξ, y) = 2\nZ R\nx sin ξx\nx2 + y2 dx = 2\nξ\nC\n-R cos ξR\nR2 + y2 + 2\nZ R\n(y2 -x2) cos ξx\n(x2 + y2)2\ndx\na\n-→4\nξ\nZ inf\n(y2 -x2) cos ξx\n(x2 + y2)2\ndx\nuniformly for ξ in compacts subsets of (0, inf).\nThe final step is the identify g(ξ, y) as πe-yξ. For this purpose, observe that\ngR(ξ, y) = -ı\nZ R\n-R\nxeıξx\nx2 + y2 dx = ∂ξfR(ξ, y)\nwhere\nfR(ξ, y) = -π\ny\nZ R\n-R\npy(x)eıξx dx -→-π\ny e-yξ.\nHence\nfR(η) -fR(ξ) =\nZ η\nξ\ngR(t, y) dt,\nand therefore\nπ\ny\ne-yξ -e-yη =\nZ η\nξ\ng(t, y) dt,\nfrom which g(ξ, y) = πe-yξ follows easily.\nExercise 7.1. Show that if f ∈L1(λR; C) and ft(x) = t-1ft-1x), then ˆft(ξ) =\nˆf(tξ).\nExercise 7.2. Show that if f ∈C2(R; C) ∩L1(λR; C) and both f ′ and f ′′ are in\nL1(λR; C), then ˆf ∈L1(λR; C).\nExercise 7.3.

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Semigroup\nSet gt(x) = (2πt)-1\n2 e-x2\n2t , and note that\n(9.1)\nZ\ngs(x -ξ)gt(ξ -y) dξ = gs+t(y -x) and ∂tgt(x) = 1\n2∂2\nxgt(x).\nFor (t, x, y) ∈(0, inf) × R × R, define\n(9.2)\np(t, x, y) = g1-e-ty -e-t\n2 x\n= 2π(1 -e-t)-1\n2 exp\nC\n-(y -e-t\n2 x)2\n2(1 -e-t)\na\n= e\nt\n2 get-1\nx -e\nt\n2 y.\nFrom the first part of (9.1) and the third equality in (9.2), we see that\nZ\np(s, x, ξ)p(t, ξ, y) dξ = e\nt\nZ\ng1-e-sξ -e-s\n2 yget-1\nξ -e\nt\n2 x dξ\n= e\nt\n2 get-e-se\nt\n2 y -e-s\n2 x = p(s + t, x, y).\nHence p(t, x, y) satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\n(9.3)\np(s + t, x, y) =\nZ\np(s, x, ξ)p(t, ξ, y) dξ.\nIn addition, using the second part of (9.1), one sees that\n(9.4)\n∂tp(t, x, y) = Lxp(t, x, y) where Lx = 1\n∂2\nx -x∂x\n.\nNext define\n(9.5)\nPtφ(x) =\nZ\nφ(y)p(t, x, y) dy\nfor φ ∈C(R; C) with at most exponential growth at inf, and use (9.3) to see that\n{Pt : t > 0} is a semigroup (i.e., Ps+t = Ps *Pt). In addition, use (9.4) to show\nthat\n(9.6)\n∂tPtφ = LPtφ.\nAfter making the change of variable y →e\nt\n2 y, one sees that another expression for\nPtφ is\n(9.7)\nPtφ(x) =\nZ\nφe-t\n2 yget-1(y -x dy =\nZ\ng1(y)φ(1 -e-t)\n2 y + x dy,\nfrom which it is easy to see that Ptφ -→φ uniformly on compact subsets as t ↘0.\nFurther, if p ∈[1, inf), then, by Minkowski's inequality,\n∥Ptf∥Lp(λR;C) ≤\nZ\ng1(y)\nAZ f(1 -e-t)\n2 y + xp dx\na 1\np\ndy = ∥f∥Lp(λR;C),\nand, as t ↘0,\n∥Ptf -f∥Lp(λR;C) ≤\nZ\ng1(y)\nAZ f(1 -e-t)\n2 y + x -f(x)\np dy\na 1\np\ndx -→0\nsince\n2∥f∥Lp(λR;C) ≥\nAZ f(1 -e-t)\n2 y + x -f(x)\np dx\na 1\np\n-→0.\n\nTherefore we know that\n(9.8)\n∥Ptf∥Lp(λR;C) ≤∥f∥Lp(λR;C) and lim\nt↘0 ∥Ptf -f∥Lp(λR;C) = 0.\nIn particular, we have now shown that {Pt : t > 0} is a continuous contraction\nsemigroup, known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, on Lp(λR; C) for each\np ∈[1, inf).\nAlthough {Pt : t > 0} is a continuous semigroup on the Lebesgue spaces\nLp(λR; C), these are not the Lebesgue spaces on which it acts most naturally. In-\nstead, one should consider its action on the spaces Lp(γ; C), where γ is the standard\nGauss measure γ(dx) = (2π)-1\n2 e-x2\n2 λR(dx). The reason why is that\ne-x2\n2 p(t, x, y) = p(t, y, x)e-y2\n2 ,\nwhich means that\n(9.9)\nφ, Ptψ\nL2(γ;C) = Ptφ, ψ\nL2(γ;C).\nHence, since Pt1 = 1,\nZ\nPtφ dγ = φ, Pt1\nL2(γ;C) =\nZ\nφ dγ.\nAt the same time, by Jensen's inequality, |Ptφ|p ≤Pt|φ|P , and so,\nZ\n|Ptφ|p dγ ≤\nZ\nPt|φ|p dγ =\nZ\n|φ|p dγ.\nThus,\n(9.10)\n∥Ptφ∥Lp(γ;C) ≤∥φ∥Lp(γ;C) for all p ∈[1, inf).\nIn addition, if φ ∈Cb(R; C), then ∥Ptφ∥u ≤∥φ∥u and Ptφ -→φ pointwise as\nt ↘0, and therefore, for each p ∈[1, inf), ∥Ptφ -φ∥Lp(γ;C) -→0 as t ↘0. Finally,\nif φ ∈Lp(R; C), then there exists a sequence {φn : n ≥1} ⊆Cb(R; C) such that\nlimn→inf∥fn -f∥Lp(γ;C) = 0, and\n∥Ptφ -φ∥Lp(γ;C) ≤∥Pt(φ -φn)∥Lp(γ;C) + ∥Ptφn -φn∥Lp(γ;C) + ∥φn -φ∥Lp(γ;C)\n≤2∥φn -φ∥Lp(γ;C) + ∥Ptφn -φn∥Lp(γ;C).\nThus, after first letting t ↘0 and then n →inf, we see that\n(9.11)\nlim\nt↘0 ∥Ptφ -φ∥Lp(γ;C) = 0 for all p ∈[1, inf).\nSummarizing, {Pt : t > 0} is a continuous contraction semigroup on Cb(R; C)\nand on Lp(γ; C) for each p ∈[1, inf), and Pt is self-adjoint on L2(γ; C).\nExercise 9.1. Show that\n(9.12)\nφ -(φ, 1)L2(γ;C)\nL2(γ;C) ≤∥φ′∥2\nL2(γ;C) for φ ∈C1\nb(R; C)\nand that\n(9.13)\nPtφ -(φ, 1)L2(γ;C)\nL2(γ;C) ≤e-tφ -(φ, 1)L2(γ;C)\nL2(γ;C)\nfor φ ∈L2(γ; C). The inequality in (9.12) is the Poincar e inequality for γ.\n\nHint: Note that if suffices to handle φ ∈C2\nb(R; C) for which (φ, 1)L2(γ;C) = 0.\nNext, given such a φ, show that\n(Ptφ)′ = e-t\n2 Ptφ′ and -∂t∥Ptφ∥2\nL2(γ;C) = ∥(Ptφ)′∥2\nL2(γ;C).\nUse these to show that\n-∂t∥Ptφ∥2\nL2(γ;C) =\n(Ptφ)′2\nL2(γ;C) ≤e-t∥φ′∥2\nL2(γ;C).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nRES.18-015 Topics in Fourier Analysis\nSpring 2024\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

To prove\nthe upper bound, first check that an\n-hk+n = (k+n)!\nk!\nhk and therefore that an\n- hk+n =\nA (k+n)!\nk!\na 1\n2 hk. Hence\nφ, hk\n\nL2(λR;C)\n2 =\nk!\n(k + n)!\nφ, an\n- hk+n\n\nL2(λR;C)\n2 =\nk!\n(k + n)!\nan\n+φ, hk+n\n\nL2(λR;C)\n2,\nand so\n∥φ∥2\nS (m+n)(R;C) =\ninf\nX\nk=0\nμm\nk\nA\nk!μn\nk\n(k + n)!\na an\n+φ, hk+n\n\nL2(λR;C)\n2.\nUsing Stirling's formula, show that\nC = sup\nk≥0\nA\nk!μn\nk\n(k + n)!\na\n< inf,\nand therefore that ∥φ∥S (m+n)(R;C) ≤C\n2 ∥an\n+φ∥S (m)(R;C). Finally, write an\n+φ as a\nlinear combination of terms of the form xk∂lφ with k + l≤n, and apply the lower\nbound to each of these terms.\nExercise 13.2: Because, by Theorem 13.5, the sequence is relatively compact,\nand, by assumption, it is pointwise convergent, it can have at most one limit.

For R > 0 define ηR(x) = ηR-1x.\n(i) Given φ ∈S (R; C), set φR = ηRφ for R > 0. Clearly φR ∈Cinf\nc (R; C) and\nφR = φ on [-R, R].

Now choose ρ ∈CinfR; [0, inf) so that ρ = 0 off\nof (-1, 1) and\nR\nρ(x) dx = 1, and define ρε(x) = ε-1ρε-1x for ε > 0. Given\nφ ∈Cc(R; C), ρε ∗φ ∈Cinf\nc (R; C) and ∥ρε ∗φ -φ∥u -→0 as ε ↘0.

Thus, if f is an entire function\nthat is not a polynomial, it can't be an element of S (R; C), which means that it\nmust grow at infinity faster than a polynomial.\nExercise 17.1: Trivially, μn\nw\n-→μ =⇒μn -→μ in S (R; C)∗, and, by Theorem\n17.3, μ -→μ in S (R; C)∗=⇒μn\nw\n-→μ.\nExercise 18.1: In the proof of Theorem 18.3, it was shown that f is a characteristic\nfunction if f(0) = 1 and\nZZ\nf(ξ -η)φ(ξ)φ(η) dξdη ≥0\nfor all φ ∈S (R; C). Thus, f is a characteristic function if and only if f(0) = 1\nand (φ, ψ)f is a non-negative quadric form. Conversely, if f is a Finally, if f = ˆμ,\nthen, by Parseval's idententy and Fourier inversion formula,\nZ\nˆφ(x) ˆψ(x) μ(dx) =\nZ\nˆφ(x) ψ∧(x) μ(dx) = (2π)-N\nZ\nˆφ ψ∧∨\n(ξ) μ(ξ) dξ\n=\nZ φ ∗ ψ(ξ)f(ξ) dξ =\nZZ\nf(ξ)φ(ξ -η)ψ(-η) dξ dη\n=\nZZ\nf(ξ -η)φ(ξ)ψ(η) dξdη.\nExercise 18.2:\n(i) If A is an bounded operator on a complex Hilbert H space and (Ah, h)H ∈R\nfor all h ∈H, then A is self-adjoint. Thus, if A =\nA 1\nf(-ξ)\nf(ξ)\na\n, then f(-ξ) =\nf(ξ), and so A is non-negative definite Hermitian matrix and 0 ≤det(A) = 1 -\n|f(ξ)|2.\nNext take\nA =\nN 1\nf(-ξ)\nf(-η)\nf(ξ)\nf(ξ -η)\nf(η)\nf(η -η)\ne\n\nand α1 = z, α2 = -1, α3 = 1.

To see that f1f2 is\nnon-negative definite, it suffices to show that if A and B are non-negative definite\nmatrices, then so is Ak,lBk,l\n\n1≤k,l≤N. To this end, use the fact that B = C C,\nwhere C is again a non-negative definite matrix.

Since, for each e ∈SN-1,\n|f(ξ + te) -f(ξ)|2\nt2\n≤21 -Ref(te)\nt2\n-→0\nas t →0, f ′ is 0 everwhere and therefore f is constant.\n(iv) Using the Hahn decompostion theorem, write μ = μ+ -μ-where μ+ ⊥μ-.\nThen, for φ ∈S (RN; C),\n(2π)N\nZ\nφ(x) μ(dx) =\nZ\nˆφ(ξ) \"\nμ+(ξ) dξ-\nZ\nˆφ(ξ) \"\nμ-(-ξ) dξ =\nZ\nˆφ(ξ)ˆμ(-ξ) dξ = 0,\nand so\nR\nφ dμ+ =\nR\nφ(x) dμ-for all φ ∈S (RN; C) and therefore μ+ = μ-.\n(v) Choose μ ∈M1(R) so that f = ˆμ. Since f is not constant, μ = δ0.\nThe first step is to show that f ′′(ξ) = -\nR\nx2eıξx μ(dx).

Knowing that x is μ-square integrable,\nit is easy to check that f ′(ξ) = ı\nR\nxeıξx μ(dx), and therefore that |f ′(ξ)|2 ≤\nR\nx2 μ(dx) = |f ′′(0)|. Finally, |f(η) -f(ξ)| ≤∥f ′∥u|η -ξ| ≤|f ′′(0)|\n2 |η -ξ|.\n(vi) It is easy to check that f must be a non-negative definite function for which\nf(0) = 1. By part (i), we know that f is continuous everywhere since it is contin-\nuous at 0. Hence, f = ˆμ for some μ ∈M1(R), and so, by Theorem 18.1, μn\nw\n-→μ.\nClearly, this proves that if {ˆμn : n ≥1} is unformly convergent at 0, then μn\nw\n-→μ\nfor some\n(vii) There is essentially nothing to do.\n\nExercise 19.1: Set Mr(dy) = 1[r,inf)(|y|) M(dy) for r > 0.

  "course_name": "Climate Action Hands-On: Harnessing Science with Communities to Cut Carbon",
  "course_description": "This course explores how citizen science can support community actions to combat climate change. Participants will learn about framing problems, design ways to gather data, gather some of their own field data, and consider how the results can enable action. Leaks in the natural gas system—a major source of methane emissions, and a powerful contributor to climate change—will be a particular focus.\nThe course was organized by ClimateX and Fossil Free MIT, with support from the National Science Foundation for the methane monitoring equipment. It was offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week January term at MIT.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nFour sessions held across 3 weeks.\n\nLectures / discussion: 2 sessions, 2 hours / session\n\nMakerspace Hands-on: 1 session, 4 hours\n\nField Hands-on: 1 session, 2 groups, 1.5 hours / group\n\nCourse Overview\n\nPut citizen science into action to tackle climate change! This course explores approaches to applying scientific data and new technologies toward climate-related research needs, community risks, and policy actions. Natural gas leaks (a major source of methane emissions) will be a particular focus. Through in-class lectures and discussion, a \"maker\"-style activity and a data collection field trip, participants will learn about effective science-based community action and practice putting that knowledge into action themselves.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis non-credit course has no prerequisites. Problem solvers of all backgrounds and experience levels are welcome. Just bring a passion for changing the world for the better and an eagerness to roll up your sleeves.\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nSESSION TYPES\n\nTOPICS\n\nLecture / discussion (2 hours)\n\nIntroduction to citizen / community science networks in operation, including Public Lab; future of community science for climate action. Discuss some relevant field examples.\n\nMakerspace Hands-on (4 hours)\n\nTools to visualize & verify: A mini-hackathon on data collection and data visualization, and a hands-on introduction to the tools for live data collection of methane gas leaks. Details on the history of natural gas infrastructure nationally and in Boston area.\n\nField Hands-on (2 x 1.5 hours)\n\nMethane leak \"safari\": A field trip to collect live data on methane leaks in the natural gas infrastructure, using a van equipped for mobile GPS-linked monitoring and a handheld probe for up-close investigation.\n\nLecture / discussion (2 hours)\n\nDiscuss the ways data can inform public decision-making: Using citizen data in legal cases, and the challenges and promise of sustainability footprints. Debrief of methane leak data collected on the prior field trip.",

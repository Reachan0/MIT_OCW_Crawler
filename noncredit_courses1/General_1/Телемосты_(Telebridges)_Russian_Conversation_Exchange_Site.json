  "course_description": "This open-access conversation exchange site offers topics and conversation tasks for students learning Russian and English. The goal of this pilot project is to support exchanges between students in English-speaking and Russian-speaking countries. \nThe conversation topics included are aligned with common college-level Russian language curricula, grouped by levels defined by ACTFL proficiency standards, and utilize OPI (Oral Proficiency Interview) practices. Topics include vocabulary, questions, and interactive activities that can be used in conversations as well as in individual practice.\nMaria Khotimsky (MIT) initiated this project based on conversation exchanges between SkolTech and MIT students, in collaboration with Dr. Marina Alexandrova (UT Austin) and Iringa Kogel (Davidson College).\nThe Телемосты website is published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA) International license.",

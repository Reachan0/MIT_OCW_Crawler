  "course_description": "This series helps learners understand magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals through the lens of source estimation, decoding, and connectivity: principles, pitfalls, and perspectives.\nMEG methodological approaches have grown remarkably during the 50-year history of MEG. A breadth of source estimation tools can localize brain activity even in challenging situations. Pattern analysis of brain activity can perform feats of mind reading by revealing what a person is seeing, perceiving, attending to, or remembering. Functional connectivity approaches can assess the role of large-scale brain networks in cognitive function. The aim of this workshop is to deconstruct these tools, overview the challenges and limitations, and demonstrate MEG data analysis procedures to a novice researcher.\nThis workshop was sponsored by the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), a multi-institutional NSF Science and Technology Center headquartered at MIT that is dedicated to the study of intelligenceâ€”how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nRecitation: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere is no course at MIT which is a prerequisite for this course. The prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. Students may also receive credit for 18.01 by transferring credit from a comparable college course taken elsewhere, or by passing an advanced standing exam.\n\nCourse Goals\n\nThe basic objective of Calculus is to relate small-scale (differential) quantities to large-scale (integrated) quantities. This is accomplished by means of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Students should demonstrate an understanding of the integral as a cumulative sum, of the derivative as a rate of change, and of the inverse relationship between integration and differentiation.\n\nStudents completing 18.01 can:\n\nUse both the definition of derivative as a limit and the rules of differentiation to differentiate functions.\n\nSketch the graph of a function using asymptotes, critical points, and the derivative test for increasing/decreasing and concavity properties.\n\nSet up max/min problems and use differentiation to solve them.\n\nSet up related rates problems and use differentiation to solve them.\n\nEvaluate integrals by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nApply integration to compute areas and volumes by slicing, volumes of revolution, arclength, and surface areas of revolution.\n\nEvaluate integrals using techniques of integration, such as substitution, inverse substitution, partial fractions and integration by parts.\n\nSet up and solve first order differential equations using separation of variables.\n\nUse L'Hopital's rule.\n\nDetermine convergence/divergence of improper integrals, and evaluate convergent improper integrals.\n\nEstimate and compare series and integrals to determine convergence.\n\nFind the Taylor series expansion of a function near a point, with emphasis on the first two or three terms.\n\nTextbook\n\nSimmons, George F.\nCalculus with Analytic Geometry\n. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, October 1, 1996. ISBN: 9780070576421.\n\nCourse Reader\n\n18.01/18.01A\nSupplementary Notes, Exercises and Solutions\n; Jerison, D., and A. Mattuck.\nCalculus 1\n.\n\nHomework\n\nThere will be 8 problem sets, due on Fridays with one exception; returned in recitation. You may turn in one problem set late with no penalty, provided you do so before solutions are given out. Partial credit may be awarded for subsequent late homework, but you must talk with your recitation instructor.\n\nExams\n\nThere will be four in-class 50 minute exams, and one 3 hour final exam.\n\nMake-up Exams\n\nIf you miss or fail an exam, you may take a make-up exam at certain arranged times. You will be notified by e-mail soon after taking an exam if you have failed it, so that you can plan for the make-up. Make-ups for failed exams can boost your grade only up to the lowest passing score (C-), which will be announced. Make-ups for full credit are permitted with a medical excuse. If you must be absent for other reasons, such as team sports, you must arrange to be excused in advance.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nWEIGHTS\n\nProblem sets\n\nExams\n\nFinal\n\nTotal",

It will be\ngraded quickly, checking that all is there and the solutions not copied.\nPart II consists of problems for which solutions are not given; it is worth more points. Some of\nthese problems are longer multi-part exercises posed here because they do not fit conveniently into\nan exam or short-answer format. See the guidelines below for what collaboration is acceptable, and\nfollow them.\nTo encourage you to keep up with the lectures, both Part I and Part II tell you for each problem\non which day you will have the needed background for it.\nPart I\n(30 points)\nNotation: 2.1 = Section 2.1 of the Simmons book;\nNotes G = section G of the Notes;\n1A-3 = Exercise 1A-3 in Section E (Exercises) of the Notes (solved in section S)\n2.4/13; 81/4 = in Simmons, respectively, section 2.4 Problem 13; page 81 Problem 4\nRecitation 0.

Read each portion of the problem before asking\nfor help. If you don't understand what is being asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and\nthen make an honest attempt to solve it.\nb) Write up each problem independently. On both Part I and II exercises you are expected to\nwrite the answer in your own words.\nc) Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If you\nfail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to serious penalties.\nd) It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters.\n0. (not until due date; 3 points)\nWrite the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you collaborated and the resources\nyou used, or say \"none\" or \"no consultation\". This includes visits outside recitation to your\nrecitation instructor. If you don't know a name, you must nevertheless identify the person, as in,\n\"tutor in Room 2-106,\" or \"the student next to me in recitation.\" Optional: note which of these\npeople or resources, if any, were particularly helpful to you.\nThis \"Problem 0\" will be assigned with every problem set. Its purpose is to make sure that you\nacknowledge (to yourself as well as others) what kind of help you require and to encourage you to\npay attention to how you learn best (with a tutor, in a group, alone). It will help us by letting us\nknow what resources you use.\n1. (Wed, 3 pts) Express (x - 1)/(x + 1) as the sum of an even and an odd function. (Simplify\nas much as possible.)\n2. (Thurs, 6 pts: 3 + 3) Sensitivity of measurement: Suppose f is a function of x. If x = x0+Δx,\nthen we define Δf = f(x) - f(x0) and Δf/Δx measures how much changes in x affect the value\nof f.\nThe planet Quirk is flat. GPS satellites hover over Quirk at an altitude of 20, 000 km (unlike\nEarth where the satellites circle twice a day). See how accurately you can estimate the distance L\nfrom the point directly below the satellite to a point on the planet surface knowing the distance h\nfrom the satellite to the point on the surface in two cases. (The letter h is for hypotenuse.)\na) Use a calculator to compute ΔL/Δh for h = h0±Δh = 25, 000±Δh, and Δh = 1, 10-1 , 10-2 .\nWrite an estimate for L in the form\n|L - L0| = |ΔL| ≤ C|Δh|\nchoosing the simplest round number C that works for all three cases.\nb) Do the same for h = 20, 001 ± Δh, Δh = 1, 10-1 , 10-2 . Is the value of L estimated more or\nless accurately than in part (a)? We will revisit this problem more systematically using calculus.\n3. (Thurs, 4pts) On the planet Quirk, a cell phone tower is a 100-foot pole on top of a green\nmound 1000 feet tall whose outline is described by the parabolic equation y = 1000 - x2 . An ant\nclimbs up the mound starting from ground level (y = 0). At what height y does the ant begin to\nsee the tower?\n\n4. (Thurs, 6 pts) 3.1/21 (parabolic mirrors)\n5.

(See full\nexplanation on PS1).\n1. (10 points: 2 + 4 + 4; and 3 extra) Golf balls\nThe area of a section of a sphere of radius R between two parallel planes that are a distance h\napart is 1\narea of a spherical section = 2πhR\nSlice the sphere of radius R by a horizontal plane. The portion of the plane inside the sphere\nis a disk of radius r ≤ R. The portion of the spherical surface above the plane is called a spherical\ncap. For example, if the plane passes through the center, then the disk has radius r = R, its\ncircumference is the equator, and the spherical cap is the Northern Hemisphere. More generally,\na spherical cap is the portion of surface of the Earth north of a latitude line. The formula above\napplies to regions between two latitude lines, and, in particular, to spherical caps.\na) Consider a spherical cap which is the portion of the surface of the sphere above horizontal\nplane that slices the sphere at or above its center. Find the area of the cap as a function of R and\nr. Do this by finding first the formula for the height h of the spherical cap in terms of r and R.\n(This height is the vertical distance from the horizontal slicing plane to the North Pole.) Then use\nyour formula for h and the formula above for the area of spherical sections.\nThis formula will be derived in Unit 4. Two examples may convince you that it is reasonable. For h = R, it gives\nthe area of the hemisphere, 2πR2 . For h = 2R it gives 4πR2, the area of the whole sphere.\n\nb) Express the formula for the area of a spherical cap in terms of R2 and r/R. (This is natural\nbecause the proportional scaling cr and cR changes the area by the factor c2.) Then use the\nlinear and quadratic approximations to (1 + x)1/2 near x = 0 to find a good and an even better\napproximation to the area of the spherical cap, appropriate when the ratio r/R is small. (Hint:\nWhat is x?) Simplify your answers as far as possible: the approximation corresponding to the\nlinear approximation to (1 + x)1/2 should be very familiar.\nc) The following problem appeared on a middle school math contest exam. The numbers have\nbeen changed to protect the innocent. Consider a golf ball that is 3 centimeters in diameter with\n100 hemispherical dimples of diameter 3 millimeters. (Note that this is not a realistic golf ball\nbecause the dimples are too deep). Find the area of the golf ball rounded to the nearest 1/100 of a\nsquare centimeter using the approximation π ≈ 3.14. (The students were given three minutes. We\nare spending more time on it.)\nUnder the rules of the contest, an incorrectly rounded answer was counted as wrong with no\npartial credit, so correct numerical approximation was crucial. Some students objected that they\ncould not figure out the area of portion of the large sphere that is removed when a dimple is\ninserted. A careless examiner had assumed that the students would use the approximation that the\narea removed for each dimple was nearly the same as the area of a flat disk. We are going to figure\nout whether this approximation is adequate or gives the wrong answer according to the rules.\nWrite down formulas for the surface area of the golf ball in the three cases listed below. (Put\nin 100 dimples, but leave r, R, and π as letters.)\ni) the approximation pretending that the removed surface is flat (what is the relationship be\ntween this and the approximations of part (b)?)\nii) the higher order approximation you derived in part (b)\niii) the exact formula\nFinally, evaluate each of the answers for the given values r = .15 and R = 1.5 centimeters, and\nfind the accuracy of the approximations.\nd) (extra credit:2 3pts) Although nobody noticed at the time, the examiner who created this\nproblem made a much bigger mistake. With the diameters actually given, it would have been\nimpossible for the number of dimples given to be placed on the golf ball without overlap. Give a\n(reasonable) estimate for the largest number of dimples that can fit on our golf ball.\n2. (4 points) Draw the graph of f(x) = 1/(1 + x2) and, directly underneath, it the graphs of\nf0(x) and f00(x). Label critical points and inflection points on the graph of f with their coordinates.\nDraw vertical lines joining these special points of the graph of f to the corresponding points on the\ngraphs below.\nExtra credit points are tabulated separately and only added to your final score at the end of the semester so that\nthey do not influence any grading cutoffs."

(Tuesday, 2pts) Hypocycloid. Show that every tangent line to the curve x 2/3 + y 2/3 = 1\nin first quadrant has the property that portion of the line in the first quadrant has length 1. (Use\nimplicit differentiation; this is the same as problem 45 page 114 of text.)\n3. (Tuesday, 7pts: 3 + 3 + 1) Sensitivity of measurement, revisited.\na) Recall that in problem 2, PS1/Part II, L2 + 20, 0002 = h2 . Use implicit differentiation\nto calculate dL/dh. Compare the linear approximation dL/dh to the error ΔL/Δh computed in\nexamples on PS1. Explain why ΔL/Δh ≤ dL/dh if the derivative is evaluated at the left endpoint\nof the interval of uncertainty (or, in other words, Δh > 0). In what range of values of h is it true\nthat ΔL\nΔh ?\n|\n| ≤ 2|\n|\nb) Suppose that the Planet Quirk is a not only flat, but one-dimensional (a straight line).\nThere are several satellites at height 20, 000 kilometers and you get readings saying that satellite 1\nis directly above the point x1 ± 10-10 and is at a distance h1 = 21, 000 ± 10-2 from you, satellite\n\n2 is directly above x2 ± 10-10 and at a distance h2 = 52, 000 ± 10-2 . Where are you and to what\naccuracy? Hint: Consider separately the cases x1 < x2 and x2 > x1.\nc) Express dL/dh in terms of the angle between the line of sight to the satellite and the horizontal\nfrom the person on the ground. (When expressed using the line-of-sight angle, the formula also\nworks for a curved planet like Earth.)\n4. (Tuesday, 5pts: 3 + 2 + 0) More sensitivity of measurement. Consider a parabolic\nmirror with equation y = -1/4 + x2 and focus at the origin. (See Problem Set 1.) A ray of light\ntraveling down vertically along the line x = a hits the mirror at the point (a, b) where b = -1/4+a2\nand goes to the origin along a ray at angle θ measured from the positive x-axis.\na) Find the formula for tan θ in terms of a and b, and calculate dθ/da using implicit differenti\nation. (Express your answer in terms of a and θ.)\nb) If the telescope records a star at θ = -π/6 and the measurement is accurate to 10-3 radians,\nuse part (a) to give an estimate as to the location of the star in the variable a.\nc) (optional; no credit) Solve for a as a function of θ alone and doublecheck your answers to\nparts (a) and (b).\n5. (Thursday, 8 pts: 3 + 3 + 2) Newton's method.\na) Compute the cube root of 9 to 6 significant figures using Newton's method. Give the general\nformula, and list numerical values, starting with x0 = 2. At what iteration k does the method\nsurpass the accuracy of your calculator or computer? (Display your answers to the accuracy of\nyour calculator or computer.)\nb) For each step xk, k = 0, 1, . . ., say whether the value is i) larger or smaller than 91/3; ii)\nlarger or smaller than the preceding value xk-1. Illustrate on the graph of x3 - 9 why this is so.\nc) Find a quadratic approximation to 91/3, and estimate the difference between the quadratic\napproximation and the exact answer. (Hint: To get a reasonable quadratic approximation, use\n9 = 8(1 + 1/8).)\n6. (extra credit 8 pts: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1) Hypocycloid, again. Here we derive the equation\nfor the hypocycloid of Problem 2 from the sweeping out property directly. This takes quite a bit\nlonger. We will look at the hypocycloid from yet another (easier) point of view later on.\nThink of the first quadrant of the xy-plane as representing the region to the right of a wall with\nthe ground as the positive x-axis and the wall as the positive y-axis. A unit length ladder is placed\nvertically against the wall. The bottom of the ladder is at x = 0 and slides to the right along the\nx-axis until the ladder is horizontal. At the same time, the top of the ladder is dragged down the\ny-axis ending at the origin (0, 0). We are going to describe the region swept out by this motion,\nin other words, the blurry region formed in a photograph of the motion if the eye of the camera is\nopen the whole time.\na) Suppose that L1 is the line segment from (0, y1) to (x1, 0) and L2 is the line segment from\n(0, y2) to (x2, 0). Find the formula for the point of intersection (x3, y3) of the two line segments.\nDon't expect the formula to be simple: It must involve all four parameters x1, x2, y1, and y2. But\nsimplify as much as possible!\nIt's important to make sure you have the right formulas before proceeding further. You can\ndoublecheck your formulas in several ways. (This is optional.)\ni) If y2 = 0, then x3 = x1.\n\nii) When the x's and y's are interchanged the formulas should be the same. What transformation\nof the plane does the exchange of x and y represent?\niii) It is impossible to find x3 and y3 if the lines are parallel, so the denominator in the formula\nmust be zero when L1 and L2 have the same slope.\niv) Rescaling all variables by a factor c leaves the formula unchanged, so the numerator of the\nformula for x3 and y3 should have degree (in all variables) one greater than the denominator.\nb) Write the equation involving x2 and y2 that expresses the property that ladder L2 has length\none. We will suppose that L1 represents the ladder at a fixed position, and L2 tends to L1. Thus\nx2 = x1 + Δx;\ny2 = y1 + Δy\nUse implicit differentiation (related rates) to find\nΔy\nlim\nΔx\n0 Δx\n→\n(Express the limit as a function of the fixed values x1 and y1.)\nc) Substitute x2 = x1 + Δx and y2 = y1 + Δy into the formula in part (a) for x3 and use part\n(b) to compute\nX = lim x3 = lim x3\nx2→x1\nΔx\n→\nSimplify as much as possible. Deduce, by symmetry alone, the formula for\nY = lim y3\nx2→x1\nd) Show that X2/3 +Y 2/3 = 1. (The limit point (X, Y ) that you found in part (c) is expressed as\na function of x1 and y1. This is the unique point of the ladder L1 that is also part of the boundary\ncurve of the region swept out by the family of ladders.)"

(Lec 19, 6 pts: 3 + 3) (+ 5 extra for part (c))\na) Suppose that at the beginning of day 0, some time last summer, the temperature in Boston\nwas y(0) = 65* Fahrenheit and that over a 50-day period, the temperature increased according to\nthe rule y0(t) = y(t)/100, with time t measured in days. Find the formula for y, and draw a graph\nof temperature on days 3 and 4, 3 ≤ t ≤ 5, and label with the correct day and shade in the regions\nwhose areas represent the average temperature each of the two days.2\n1A more colorful way of expressing 4B-6 is in terms of the volume of a tent, as in the textbook problem 7.3/7.\nUnfortunately, the problem is ill-posed and can't be done without pretending that the cross-sections are triangles.\nIn real life, the canvas would have creases. In general, the shapes formed by stretching canvas or nylon over various\narrays of tent poles are quite hard to compute.\n2The continuous average of a function is\nZ b\nf(x)dx\nb - a\na\nIn this case b - a = 1, so the average is the same as integral. For more, see Notes, AV, and Lecture 23.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nb) The number of cooling degree days is the sum for each day of the difference between the\naverage temperature for that day and 65*. The number is used to estimate the demand for electricity\nfor air conditioning. Draw a second graph of y for the whole 50 days and shade in the region whose\narea represents the total number of degree days. Write a formula for this total area as the difference\nbetween 65 50 and a definite integral. Evaluate the definite integral using the fundamental theorem\n·\nof calculus. (Alternatively, write the whole quantity as an integral expressing the area between\ncurves as in Lecture 21, and 7.2.)\nc) (extra credit) Compute the definite integral in part (b) directly by evaluating a lower Riemann\nsum and taking a limit. Follow the procedure in Problem 5, PS4, but with different scale factors.\nThis rather elaborate calculation shows how much time and effort we save every time we use the\nfundamental theorem and the change of variable formula in integrals.\nx\n2.

The square root of the average value\nof V 2 over one period of V (t) (or cycle) is called the root-mean-square voltage, abbreviated RMS.\nThis is what the voltage meter on a house records. For house current, find the RMS in terms of\nthe constant C. (The peak voltage delivered to the house is ±C.

(Lec 24, 6pts) The basis for Simpson's rule is the following formula. Let x1 be the midpoint\nof the interval [x0, x2], and denote its length by 2h. Consider any three points (x0, y0), (x1, y1),\n(x2, y2). There is a unique quadratic function (parabola)\ny = Ax2 + Bx + C\nwhose graph passes through the three points. Simpson's rule says that the area under the parabola\nabove [x0, x2] is\nh(y0 + 4y1 + y2)\nThis problem is devoted to proving this formula. It is significant because it illustrates how calcu\nlations can be simplified by using symmetry, and by looking ahead to see what you need.\nSince the area will be the same if the parabola is translated to the left or right, we may assume\nthat x0 = -h, x1 = 0, and x2 = h. Then in terms of the rest of the data (i.e., h and the yi)\nmake a sketch and determine C;\nshow, by integrating, that to find the area we need only determine A (or better, 2Ah2);\ndetermine 2Ah2 using the data;\nput the results together to establish the formula for area.\n5.

(Lec 30, 9 pts: 3 + 1 + 3 + 2) The hyperbolic sine and cosine are defined by\ncosh x = ex + e-x\n,\nsinh x = ex - e-x\n\na) Show that\nd\nd\ni)\nsinh x = cosh x and\ncosh x = sinh x.\ndx\ndx\nii) cosh2 x = 1 + sinh2 x and\n1 + cosh 2x\niii) cosh2 x =\nb) What curve is described parametrically by x = cosh t, y = sinh t? (Give the equation and\nits name.)\nc) The curve y = cosh x is known as a catenary. It is the curve formed by a chain whose two\nends are held at the same height.\ni) Sketch the curve\nii) Find its arclength from the lowest point to the point (x1, cosh x1) for a fixed x1 > 0.\nd) Find the area of the surface of revolution formed by revolving the portion of the curve from\npart (c) around the x-axis. This surface is known as a catenoid. It is interesting because it is the\nsurface of least area connecting the two circles that form its edges. If you dip two circles of wire in\na soap solution, then (with some coaxing) a soap film will form in this shape. In general, the soap\nfilms try to span a frame of wires with a surface with the least area possible.\n3. (Lec 31, 11 pts: 3 + 2 + 2 + 4) Area in polar coordinates.\na) Find the area of the right triangle with vertices at (x, y) = (0, 0), (x, y) = (a, 0) and at\n(x, y) = (a, h), using polar coordinates. (One of the less convenient ways to find the area of a\ntriangle.)\nb) Find the equation in (x, y) coordinates for the curve r = 1/(1 + sin θ) and sketch it.\nc) Find the area of the region 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/(1 + sin θ), 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, using the rectangular coordinate\nformula you found in part (b).\nd) Find the area of the region in part (c) using polar coordinates. One way to evaluate the\nintegral is to change variables to u = θ - π/2, and then use the half angle formula\n1 + cos u = 2 cos2(u/2)\nThis area was already computed in part (c), but the polar coordinate formula is still valuable\nbecause it gives the area of any sector, not just the one that is bounded by a horizontal line. The\narea swept out from the viewpoint of the focus of an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is related by\nKepler's law to the speed of planets and comets."

Dec. 12 Continuation and review.\nFinal Examination: Thursday, Dec. 21\nThe final examination will cover the entire semester's work, including all the material since\nExam 4, namely, L'Hˆopital's rule, improper integrals, infinite series, power series.\nTo prepare for it, make sure you understand the solutions to the problems on the four hour\nexams and to the practice problems given out for each of the hour exams. If you find you still have\ntrouble with some topics, go back to the problem sets which covered those, and practice on the\nrelevant Part I problems that were assigned for them. A practice final exam will be posted.\nThe table of formulas from Exam 4 will be printed with the final exam. Some problems on the\nexam related to techniques of integration may be in a new format, namely, you will be given an\nintegral formula that follows a method of integration, (integration by parts, partial fractions, or\nsubstitution) and asked to find the mistake(s) in it. The final exam will test the notion of weighted\naverage (see Problem 4, Exam 3).\nMakeup 18.01 during IAP\nStudents who receive a D in 18.01 this semester will be eligible to take a review course during\nIAP. It counts as 6 units on the IAP load, so students also in 8.01L can continue with that course.\nStudents who pass this review course will receive the usual 12 units credit for having passed 18.01.\nThe IAP review course consists of daily one or two hour review sessions, going through the\nentire course, with the hour exams occurring at the relevant times (and a make-up hour exam the\nnext day, for those who failed the earlier one). In general, there will be two or three review sessions\npreceding each exam. At the end is a final exam.\nStudents who receive an F in 18.01 this semester will in general not be eligible for the review\ncourse; they should retake 18.01 in the spring. If there are extenuating circumstances which make\nit likely that the student will be able to pass the review course, they can be considered.\nStudents who fail 18.01 will be notified by e-mail the day after the final, so they can make plans\nfor the IAP course if they wish to do so and are eligible for it."
